good but need updates and improvements
worst mobile i have bought ever battery is draining like hell backup is only 6 to 7 hours with internet uses even if i put mobile idle its getting dischargedthis is biggest lie from amazon  lenove which is not at all expected they are making full by saying that battery is 4000mah  booster charger is fake it takes at least 4 to 5 hours to be fully chargeddont know how lenovo will survive by making full of usplease dont go for this else you will regret like me
when i will get my 10 cash back its already 15 january

not as described screen cast cant work with tv miracast and fast charging is take upto 215 hours contacts vcf files only download with google drive not by sd card total disappointed
this is the device for average usage battery could not last for a day the biggest con of this phone is its battery though it has 4000 mah battery but it drains very fast camera quality is good not very good specially depth enabled mode focus is not perfect the thing i like most about this device is display

firstly product not delivered on time dissatisfied 2 weekssecondly android 711 naugat doesnt have call recording optionthirdly when selling product cost was 13999 now why drastically dropped 10999fourthly when talking over the phone feels like nerve pulling to much radiation need immediate fix on this matter as its safety and security of customerfifthly if any issues in hardware issues please let us know the service centers location and please ensure hardware availability should be there at any time when customers bookedfinally as discribed about product all features are ok no issues found as mentioned earlier if call recording option would have added the this product would have been met the expectationscamera quality is good not bad snap attached
excellent product
nice  amazing
the device restarts automatically
bought this product recently from amazon thoroughly dissatisfied with the phone a thumbs down for this one
really killer
hello all before you purchase remember battery performance of this device is very very poor check the picture i attached there was no use from 8 hourssleeping and i make sure data was off still see battery draining in idle mode really bad performanc and this super turbo charger they calling is waste its below thn average charger really disappointedi have just raised return requestpros  rest all goodcameradesignperformance etc
to wrest phone is hang problem
happy with the product ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÇ
very bad product lots of malfunction donot take this product
the look and sleekness of this phone is good but the features in this phone is very less as this phone doesnt have the basic features like no sound controler option in shortcut shutter and most importantly there is no voice call recorder and the camera quality is also not good it is average in performance
third class phone this time lenovo disappointed me i have k3 and k4 note so bought k8 note without any kind of thinking and disappointed it stucks anytime without any load to ram battery is also third class defuces in very short time and turbo charge works sometimes but most of the time it works as normal chargergallery and many othet apps arent available as it has stock android best thing is it often shows that processandroidcom stopped workingwhat the 
ok with the product but the problem was it gets shut down while charging
i love lenovo k8 note handset but i replace 3 times turbo charger in allahabad service centre within 6 month it becomes turbo charging to slow charging plz lenovo fix it i request u
really good to buy
great features
gift raping is very poorwords also very small please refund money for that work
i personally dont recommend to buy this product if anyone want to connect tv over cast screen option option is available but not compatible with any other device other than chromecast for casting though it was available for other model of lenovo phone
good
if you are looking for a mid range phone u can go for this features are pretty good but some small problems arises now and then if ignored then worth the money
as sim slot was not working i returned and got fast delivery too so giving 5 star bcz i m lenovo fan and i just love mobile the best mobile of this year it get hot in less time but i guess we ca ignore it bcz the phone is vgood and with lots of good features and killer look too
worst for gaming and music i bought this for the deca core processor it has but it works worse than a quad core processed phone and it said it has 2 speakers but one of them left doesnt have a speaker just holes to cheat buyers decent camera and display battery could be made better and the ram keeps on working for 50  60 even while the phone is not in use
really awsome
there is heating and battery backup problem
nice phone 
product is good purchased on sep17 and got cash back on 25dec17 what a way to make fool they called it cash backlol
nice mobile
mobile is good but heating problem is one thing thateffecting its popularity
in this segment its very good productcamera is also greatsound is greatover all superb
mobile in good working process more than expect but charger have big drawback its not a turbo charger very late charging the mobile

high expectation hurts üò™ dual camera is not upto the mark apart from that no issues at all 4g4g logic needs to be made clear
i bought the lenovo k 8 on the first sales daybut very much disappointed with the dolby atmos feature on the lenovo k 8it does not sound good at all when switch on also it sound so weak and not punching at all when i compare it with a lenovo k6 can i get a sofwares updates to make it sound goodor is it that i got a defective phoneplease let me know at the earliest
its battery is draining very fast
back camera images not so gooda yellow shadow occurred
functions of the phone are not good performance is also wrost total waste of money please dont buy this phone what ever they are showing in their add is false please go for mi or any other brand which give very good mobile at this range
nice product
the worst phone i bought again from the lenovo before i though with stock android it will perform good but the same story battery drain in idle time dual camera is a joke and still no fix update as lenovo known for it please do not buy it
very good
good mobile heating problem but its normal
bad quality
phn is gud n nicebut the battery is draining too fastbattery is not 4000mah too bad
nice
some time display is not working prpperly
major disadvantage of this model is battery is not detachableexcept that all features and working so nice
battery backup is very good
i am using lenovo k8 note 4gb 64gb model xt19023 type m2cb2 since last ten days i am not fully satisfied with this product because i found one problem amazon described in the product description that this handset has both sim slots with 4g enabled but it is found that slot 1 support 4g whereas slot 2 supports only 3g not 4g
its just a okay phoneno such effects of dual cameras
not a dual 4g support
one sim slot is 3g that is disadvantage otherwise awesome
features are really good but some backlogs1 though it has 4gb ram sometimes mobiles struck and delay in responding2 4000mah battery runs out quickly like 3100 mah3 delay in camera operating response4 delay in contact searching its irritating when we search for a contact and getting more time to save a contact5 very worst mobile in this rangefriends pls dont buy it go for some better mobilei swear u will regret after you use it
very bad camera
front camera good but sound need to improve
amazing product in reasonable price range
not expected at all left speaker channel is false only right speaker working camera is avarage double tap wakeup is not working properly earphone sound quality is not better  using jbl not satisfied
poor camera
not a good product
the product is awesome
great phone
hang hota hai phone
great phone with excellent connectivity quick charging and excellent talk time due to the large battery the twin camera requires steadier hands than mine ota update to android 80 but the bluetooth connection on this phone is intermittent and unstablesupplementary information the claimed gorilla glass 3 screen is probably ordinary glass as it cracked as the phone slipped from my grasp while sitting on a sofa lenovo says the screen is not covered reducing rating to two stars
fast delivery delivery is to be provided for all districts good phone feels a bit heavy notification sounds cant be adjusted is a bit annoying photos takes a lot more memory but not as much clarity for that memory other features are good
i want return it
me bodru using lenovo k8 note from 29th augustthis mobiles performance so goodbut its battery does note perform as another 4000mhz battery mobileso plz check it and try to solve it
very poor batterybattery drain within 8 hrsits doesnt show the 4000 mah performance
it is good üòéüòé smooth 
not too good  configuration is high but auto deduced when calling or listing due to auto touch to screen so huge problem is
purchased on 22 nd jan 2018 average phone at this price segmentthough the cameras are supposed to be high performance but not satisfiedbattery charged quickly and lasts for a full day onlylookswise ok lenovo again a name you can trust uponbut dont buy with too much expectations simply an average smart phone and off course good for rough use
not expected about the k8 performance is that muchim really happy about the product in all specificationsand the thanks to amazon for given me good and non damaged product in time
the best phone in terms of specifications audio sound battery screencamera ram rom alongwith corning gorilla glass all the best things in a mobile without burning ur pocket
lacks some apps like pc connection etc
good phone after update
its good
not a good phone in only 25 month it started hanging with more than 25 gb available memory in the phone camera is not also good now lenovo have to seriously think about the performance of their mid range phones
ye amazon wale both bc hai  phn kharida lenovo k8 note usme game ka hanging issue hai bc replace k ly bolte hai par behanchod layla dete hai bhosdi ke pese jane ke bad service bhi nai dete inka technician bhosdi ka game khelke kenya hai koi problem nai hai  in behanchod me copy phone bhej diya much mat kaharidna amazon se  bhot bhosdi wale hai
volte calls  sms not coming in when the phone is in standby mode
all things are good about this phonesmoothly running and no problem till now
this phone is goodbut camera is not so good as 13mpover all its good phone heating problem during charging
worst depth effect honestly if you want to buy a phone with depth effect then go for mi a1 but this is not for youif you are a selfie holic then i recommend you to buy this phone bcz the selfie here is literally good as compare to other phones in this price range this phone is on top in terms of selfiein terms of processor ill say that snapdragon 625 is much better then this bcz this phone will not save your battery as redmi phones does and this processor is built on 20 nm technology and snapdragon 625 is on 14 nm thats 625 is battery efficient but lenovo is providing you fast charger which is about 15w so dont worry you can get your day battery in just 1 hr if you plug your phone on 20 then it will get charge 70 to 80 in just 1 hr which can last upto 8 hrson minimal usage so if you really want to buy this one ill recommend you to buy this but keep in mind some cons of this phone when youre buying it
its an excellent phonebut sometimes heating problem may occuroverall phone is very good in every conditioncamera quality processor turbo charging and many more fabulous features

most disgusting phone ever heating issues bad camera low battery level battery heats so much that i am afraid that it may burst i am planing to throw this mobile its a threat to lifebad service by amazon also earlier those people said phone would be return according to return policy but they gave wrong information they are asking me to go to lenovo customer care and get it verified even if it is faulty even being in returnable period this is really disappointing i strongly recommend people not to buy this garbage from this site
this lenovo k8 was fine for two days subsequently it takes more than 8 hrs to charge inspite of rapid charger  i have been to thier auth service center in vain as they are not aware of the product  solution  i had given k5 for service under warranty its still lying with them for more than 17 days this became defective for using google navigation got over heated  switch off  this makes me rethink about lenovo products through amazon sale
good
the phone is awesome a must buy product value for money product ignore some small drawbacks

i am a movie lover wanted to watch them on my big tv screen by casting them from my new k8 note i have an android tv box  not chrome castthere is a option in phone to cast under displaybut disappointingly the phone could not find the tvto me this a major draw back it may not be a serious issue for those who do not use mirroringworst thing was when i wanted a solution from lenovo team through live chat the person who was chatting one mr saleem says k8 can cast only through chrome castfurther when i was typing my next question he abruptly disconnectedthere are also lot many posts by several users complaining about the casting issue on k8 note
nice phone best specifications
its very nice product and i use the phone and i very happy

very good
looking stylist but sometimes network problem found
a good product by lenovo and delivery was great by amazon dual camera may be much better but its depth enabled mode needs more improvement overall the performance of phone is good
pros are more here than cons 
very bad network connection every day network problem
draining battery fast heating when the phone is plugged into charge in off mode network issues in calling using jio processor performance is also not good
i bought this phone for my friendhe is pretty happy with the phoneall the specs meet his daily basic requirementsbuta highly skinned os makes it little fullotherwise a great tech
battery is poor again disappointed with lenevo cant work whole day with so called 4000mah lenevo should work on this and camera part also which is poor

sound quality is not good and also no gallery to store images need to download for play storerest everything is perfect
good phone
over all good phone a little bit of heating while charging which i think is normal as turbo charge else no heating problem a nice looking device camera quality is not as expectedbattery backup is good after playing games and spend good online on airtel 4g network i charge the battery to 100 in morning time and at the end of the day i am ending up with 4045 battery remaining a better product in this price range
nice
i found everything what expected except headphone
the fone is overall good but there are issues with network connections especially while using volte on jio
totally waste
it was good but in this heating is main disadvantage but everything is good
amazing
no contacts in phone everything to be stored to google in bigger font size the display ia going out of screen the signal indicator ia never fullnot a great phone compared to its predecessors
i had purchased on 08102017 after using more than 15 days found that device fault of software mobile getting hang and restart automatically same issue consulting with lenovo customer care as per there technical solutions till problem not solvedafter that i was visited lenovo care mapusa goa as per there technical expertise need of software upgrade after software updated till issue not resolved after this there technical expertise person said need of change of mother board i have questions about lenovo product that mobile not having any physical and water dimage then how could possible mother board probleam and in goa there is no any lenovo care centre in margao and panjim its near about 50 km from margao so weast of my valuable time which is more cost than my money and also weast of my money  please do not go for this product bad service faulty products
this phone is very goodi like this phone
got the phone delivered on time  that is the only good thing in this entire experience of mine  updated now a new update  the first update didnt provide any noticeable difference but this ones log looks promising lets seei have been using various models of mobiles  have never seen such a terrible device   bought this after much thoughts by trusting the name lenevo i have been using redmi note 4  it never had any issues with battery or even camera  listening to music through youtube  browsing facebook  insta  still solid backup for more than a dayi have 4 other phones also  moto g3  samsung s3  htc 628g  samsung j7 prime this phonelenevo k8 seems to be worst among all1battery  has left me shattered with its worst battery life  have just used to take some pictures  youtube  songs  it goes down very fast  yet to enter two sim card  use whatsapp  gmail  so if it continues to become more worst id surely update  escalate this 2camera qualityfor a dual camera  it is nowhere near honor 6x which is 1k lesser if you are tricked by the dual camera  it still has not got update of slowmo  time lapse  but it is really good when taken in professional mode with manual iso  focussinga disaster in auto mode  that too for a rear camera with dual lens i wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out ota update for camera  battery life improvementother than that  the phone is super smooth  display  touch  finger print sensor  stock android is a bit of self satisfaction that i can say to myself for wasting 14k i thought of gifting it to my father  but this would make it surely an incomplete gift wish the company looks into these issues  provides updates for the camera  battery life because that is what it was paid for  marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factorslost interest to even post pictures of itwith much regret
it was launched as the next big thing in budget smartphones and claimed to have the best camera in that rangephone is okdecent battery life not the best but still a decent cameraafter 45 months of use i found it starts to hang a bit but i guess that‚Äôs normal with low budget android devices
not very great phone it says it has turbo charge but it takes four hour to reach 100 not worth buying
very bad mobile dont buy it
4000mah battery but doesnt work aslow battery backupoverall 4 but for battery 2

after using few weeks i can say this phone has met all my expectations and i am completely satisfied with it specially with camera and it‚Äôs effects battery is up to the mark dolby speakers works really good no issues with memory supports 4g on both sim cards wifi connectivity is also goodhowever there is some issue related to cell phone networks specially during roaming areas i could say there is small lack in the network chipset due to which sometimes it puts you in a situation where it‚Äôs doesnt shows you any kind of signal whereas other phones could get the network very easilyoverall performance is really good and satisfactoryapart from this i haven‚Äôt received my jet previledge bonus points which i supposed to get for this orderthanks
from the begining its google not respondingsometime it gives the feelings that i bought a second hand mobile
gud buy for people looking for budget oriented smartphonehappy tht lenovo has improved its camera

my brother liked it very much he is happy with the mobile and its features thanks lenovo and thanks amazon

pathetic phone here is why this one is a flop show dont even think of buying this so called phone even a brick is better1 takes 3 hours to fully charge sometimes charges in half an hour once i was stuck at 43 percent for nearly 10 mins2 phone doesnt allow you to answer a call sometimes the screen just freezes3 doesnt latch on to network properly you get lots of missed calls alerts4 some apps such as trucaller dont work wellthis is the last lennovo device i ever buy
battery drains very fast when im using continuously  the battery drains from 100 to 0 within 4 hrs  being the battery 4000 mah
swipe to unlock unlocks the phone with out even asking password
mobile is not working
its the best phone i ve ever used since i am born
nice phone at this price rangedeca core processor was awesome it loads games quicklyi received an update for slow motion recordinghope receive an update for 4 k tecordingonly drawback is the camera quality is lower than redmi note 4 and moto g5s plusthis phone doesnt sense the natura color of images properly than its competitors battery life is average dont expect too much life as 4000 mahi hope lenovo might solve this probs through updatemy rating was 37
not satisfiedover heating
this is really an awesome mobile phone
mobile is good but not received proper bill and there is no emi no mentioned on bill
phone is good but features is not well old features and functions in this phone

great mobile with deca core and good ram
good price good phone
if you have this than you become photographer
few cons to considerthis product heats a lot during gaminggps navigationcamera and chargingswitch off switch on time reboot time s bit more
nice but if you can afford 2000 extra than you should go for moto g5s plus
bad experience ever not expect from lenovothis phone has hardware issue and heating problem as well as batterylow backup turbocharger takes1and half hour to chargewrost experience ever
good mobil
this phone has whatever i need plus its in budget
usb data cable is not working
device is getting heated with any application usage for more than 5 mins
this device running smoothly for 25 monthsafter that hanging problem eg then data is book cant open very slowly change and many more problems in this device
im loving it so fargreat specs awesome performancethe best in its price range for surethe only complaint if any is that it uses only one of its dual cameras for normal photos and so takes like 3 seconds to focus on a page
very amazing phone in this price
bad phone
awsome
all of sudden phones sim slot isnt workingi think its a hardware problemkindly fix it as soon as possible
excellent mobilecamera clarity superb front  back 48display clarity fine 45battery ok 42signal issue is very high 35os speed ok45better than mi note 4overall parformence is good
budget phone average battery fast charger saved the show front camera is good rear camera in normal mode is good but struggles in depth enabled mode dual sim plus dedicated memory slot is added advantage a bit of android glitches were observed but nothing to worry looks are good venom black colour is quite impressive
this phone is amazing its camera is too good perfect for selfi
got scratch in gorilla glass after 10 days usecan i get replacement
it is really a nice phone
nyc product
phone is nice but i think mi y1 is best price difference also big between them
camera decent perfomance good heating issue battery backup not good
worst phone i have ever seen battery not comes even half a day i have called several times to amazon to return the phone but their response also worst than this phone
after around 3 months i finally came to a conclusion that this phone is average in all fields battery last for around 1 day of moderate usage after an overnight charge heating issues facing since the day i bought it gaming performance is goodi have tried all types of games including gta san andreas and nova 3 there are no lags in the performance the mediatek processor produce enough juice to pump the phone i liked the selfie camera more than the primary one as the bokeh effect is crap and the single camera is also not good enough and here comes the major problem im having whenever any song is played on bluetooth connected speaker and the data is on the musoc starts distorting overall an average phone i think theres more out there in this price range but its not a complete failure regretting after buying
camera performance are not good
i been using it for last 4 days and the phone is actually a killer that being said by lenovo killer i hope that the phone doesnt really kills me cause the only thing that is bothering me is this heating issue while charging
awesome performance good clarity awesome features
awesome phone in this price
its been almost more than 2 weeks that i am using this phone and have not faced a single issue its worth every penny sturdy built good hold awesome touch loud speaker super battery backup good rear and front cameras and top it all stock android go for it

i have purchased 3 lenovo mobile in past 1 year but lenovo quality going to decreasing day by day recently i have purchased new lenovo k8 note on 8 feb 2018 and its start over heating after 20 days and now its battery start drains quicker now my mobile is switch off and i relay dont want to use it again even i will never use lenovo mobile again my rating is 5 for this product
for someone
almost a average phone  the dual rear camera is not so good  suggested not to buy this in 2017 end and in 2018  go for better redmi or another brands 
super mobile good product n sounds also so good charge stand by for 2 days camera is super more than 3 mths im using tis mobile lovely mobile from lenovo n best price from amazon so thankful for such good product for amazon planning to shop more n more from amazon oly ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÑüòç

value for money
battery drain issue after oreo update charging time 5 to 6 hours  drain time 3 to 4 hours worst customer support
gorilla 3 just a name only brought this phone on march 2018 and screen didnt last 4 months also got cracked after falling from few meterscan anyone please give me the link for original genuine screen replacement lcd folder with the same curve and display brightness
supar phone
to begin with considering the price range i never had lot of expectations from this phone now that i have received it and used it for over 24 hours i would rate my experience as goodthe touch of the phone is very good soft and feels premiumbattery life is good however it does not show battery percentage on the main screencamera comes under average performance the depth mode doesnt really serves the purpose here honor 6x has better camera than k8performance of the phone is goodso overall this is a good phone and when it comes to camera its closest rival honor 6x takes the lead
its been only 1 month and it started giving troubleits overheating and taking more hours for charging and giving less battery backup
mobile is very good but it has heating issue
screen is not antiscratchscratch occurs in my mobile when it fall downbad gorilla glassscreen quality is not good
worst battery backup comes for only 6 hrs depth focussing camera is not effective as expected other features are good
nice mobile cpu is very best i love it
lenovo hyped this phone for its dual rear camera and a deca core mediatek processor and believe me these are the most worst things in this phonecamera  the dual rear camera is of no use it gives a fake bokeh effect in depth enabled mode the camera struggles to focus you will find the edges of the object are blurred along with the background without depth enabled mode both front and back cameras are just averageprocessor  battery  the mediatek helio x23 processor is good in performance but since it is clocked at 23 ghz the gets heated even on normal uses or while while charging it aslo consumes the battery very fast the 4000 mah battery will hardly last for 1 day on normal usessound clarity  nice sound clarity on speaker as well as earphone thanks to dolby atmosdisplay  screen clarity is goodui  its a user choice i am not a stock android fan as it lacks many features comes with custom roms like miui otherwise there is no problems with ui it runs pretty smoothfinal verdict  its just a average phone there are many other good options available in market at same price point if you are camera lover and want a good camera phone then go for honor 6x if you want good performance then go for redmi note 4 and if you want good performance with stock android then buy a moto g5
very poor graphics
user friendly
bekar ha mat lo
good product

perfect selfie phone
it gets very hot while using i was using lenovo k4 for last one year and was more satisfied with that rather this one  13999 main drawback of this phone arebeautiful cast screen mirror doesnt work bluetooth is also disturbing touch screen is not as sensitive as it should be with 4gb ram and 64 gb internal memory with 10 core processer display got broken very early with in two months of use its very normal and not as strong as k4 hand grip is not good voice clarity not good and dolby sound is just normal and speakers are very normal and sound is low k4 was much better in this regard call logs and call recording another big drawback of this phone i will not recommend this phone for purchase even  the cost of 10k
not too good
all good but fingerprint sensor not working sometime
getting heat up very soon not satisfactorywhile you will try to returnit will tell somany stepsbut you cant returnand from last months order till now no return of money back of sbi card

hard ware button stopped suddenly using soft button as of now
1 touch is tacky and have very slow response2 no head setearphone supplied with this phone one may ten to overlook this point in excitement of other specification being offered there are better alternatives available in same price a phone works in synergy with box packed items and if i have to buy a headphone separately its a big no for this product

one of the best phone in the market with an excellent affordable pricethe features are excellent and you get everything you want under a cheap price
lenovo mobile ones network problem comes total motherboard change
the battery drain is absolutely horrible even while not using the phone the battery drains like crazyi tried to return the phone only to have the amazon customer service run some kind of diagnostic on it and declare that the battery is fine essentially turning me into a liar
not at all good antenna is very poor not receiving the signal properly missed many calls besides cameras are not of good quality so returned the item
very good and powerful phone
everything is fine except1 notification light didnt blink when msg and miss call arrived only blink when text msg arrived2 heating issue3 turbo charger is not like turbo its look like normal 2 amp charger4 battery draning fastly5 camera lence coverd with dust after few days use

this is my 3rd lenovo phone not worth the money though1 poor camera quality  though its a dual camera2 little lagging in the games even though its deca core with 4gb ramthe only plus is that it is not a hybrid sim
inspite of visit 7 times to service center still the problem is not resolved dont buy this phone waste of money the phone couldnt run properly just 1 year service center  phone service employees will gave u lame excuses and tell u to waitworstphoneshamelenovo
configruation is gr8 but ui is very poor at least somethings could have been added to make it user friendly ultimate power saver and many other basic options are missing it heats up while charging and customization options are totally zero i hope maybe if they give oreo update they add some features hardware is ultimate but what its worth without a proper software utilizing it please add some features or make it open for us to use cyanogenmod and there will not be any warrenty void issue
good phone
best phone i ever used
excellent
in 12000 it is a great phone some heat up issues and ram management is poor its gpu performance is slightly lower than adreno gpu in 64 gb storage i get almost 51 gb camera performance and ram management may be improve in software updates battery lasts about 1 day for heavy userssome bugs in ui in 24 nov i simply using it and for 30 to 40 minutes it completely stop and after 1 hour it recoveredso these are my opinion regarding this phonei bought it on sell for 12000 4 gb ram 64 gb internal storageso it is a decent phone for my point of viewthank you

charger is so slow charging to phone so please can you replace the chargerthe charger take 7to 8 hours full charging to phone
very superb lenovo k8 but please impore the camera setting and plz gives the updatesand battery backup awesome
mobile goes to very heat not user friendly like no speed dial no screenshot less dial settings fast discharging cant send via bluetooth etci want to return or i should sell this mobile i am disappointed just only worth for cost
very good prdt
camera quality was not up to given standardsvery impressed with fast charging as well as battery backupwothy mobile at this price
not the beast  cameras depth sensing is not that good though very good selfie camera chipset is way powerfull battery drains fast but after a software update its ok now
worst productscreen cast wont work which is a basic feature
yes
delicate screen was broken and cost rs4500 waste of money
i purchased this phone  but i recommend to buy mi a1 or honor 6x in this price segment  lenovo is lazy in terms of providing updates phone have serious bugs in camera depth mode slow motion video is pathetic  you will never gona use it front camera gives soft picturesbackground app crashes flicking screen is there not muchthese bugs could be cured by throwing an update  but lenovo will not do it  because if they made this phone perfect who will gona buy there moto phones phone is good in terms of design and screen  it feels good in hand stock android is a bonus
worth to use online usage
as soon as i bought the mobile from the courier person i eagerly transferred songs from my older mobile and started the google music player in lenovo k8 note to experience its fantastic dolby atmos surround sound which i had experienced in lenovo k4 note but i was very much disappointed that lenovo k8 note doesnt provide dolby atmos surround sound at alldear manufacturers kindly take your previous edition lenovo k4 note and check its sound and compare it with k8 it is worst as your competitors dolby atmos dont replicate those duplicate dolby atmos come back again with dual front facing speakers as lenovo k4 which has excellent dolby atmos experience and even using top branded headphone did not give much difference between with dolby atmos and without dolby atmos optionthe main reason why i bought lenovo k8 note is the lenovos real dolby atmos sound as i thought before buying otherwise your competiror has all other specifications as k8 but even lenovo started making false promise like your competitor that the mobile has dolby atmos by just enabling some equilizer options like just we had in 2000s mobiles but the output is null
good mobile for the price
till date excellent product
waste mobile no signal in mobile
worst product supplied by amazon trader received my new phone today dated 05092017 after installing google services and my account it immediately showing blur screen and not a single button works i have made 23 videos in my mobile which i definitely going to post on social media sites to aware people for not to buy lenove k8 note
worst phonebatry bckup is worstsuddenly while playing games it stops working from the first day i have gone to its service center they told that we have to update its softwarethey called me at 2 pm but i have gone to 4 pm to them but then were tlng it will take 1 more hour and after 1 hour they told that you will get your handset tommorowafter soft update also this problem continuedand now i m returning itcall quality is worstmy opposite side person unables to hear my voice clearlyand headphone jack also not workingwhen it just gets touched by my finger sound stops ar video get paused
battery back problem
nothing extraordinary to call it a killer note camera which lenovo has boasted of is poor like all previous lenovo phones the dual camera setup is just a gimmick and takes ordinary quality photos dolby atmos sound output is of average quality it was better on earlier lenovos the headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovos redmi  mi samsungs making k8 note pure android experience lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovos hence the software is a big let down lenovo should have stripped down the vibe ui to near stock experience instead of dumping it also a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock androidin my opinion k8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovos were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them
i have faced phone ringing issue i need to repair it
good
received handset on 22nd  still havnt start using it due to some personal problemslet me start using it then only i will b able to provide my reviewthnks
super
worst phone battery heating issues slowed down drastically better not to go with this company for purchase of the mobile
waste of money
not a good mobile
very nice phonecamera is very goodno heating issuevery satisfied
hi all i have bought new lenovo k8 note frankly speaking lenovo making fool to customer through this product just for marketing they have given higher features in this pricelike 4gb ram 64gb rom dual camera but all are of no use if you buy some other company with lesser feature compared to this you will get much better experience the most stupid thing lenovo done is very basic features they have removed like led notification is there but it never works except during charging no call recording no shortcuts for screen shot i got alert saying low battery and 15 was there then automatically switched off immediatelythese feedback by just exploring little let me explore more than i ll share with more feedback
features at this price are not regrettable but the price slashed by 1000 in just one month made me think about the brand as a wholeso all said it is a decent deal at this price if you are not concerned about the camera quality
good phone in this price
product is good nice packing without earphones
battary drained fastits look like ordinary charger it i s taking 2 and half hour full chargeweight is more compare todays phone
very worst product dont buy k 8 while charging it getting highly heat pls pls dont buy

wow so amazing phone
the lenovo k8 note is really a killer phone if you are searching for a smart phone that is totally balanced from all prospects then this is your phoneüòçbut why lenovo why you used mediateküò≠
very bad experience with the product and also with the amazon policy the mobile is getting very hot while charging talking on phone listening of music dont trust on lenovo k8 note while purchasing online
dont buy this phone at all its batteries draining very fast and cameras qualities very poor on return request phone has been tested through their software showing everything ok just check the credentials that software poor rank given by allsee the photos and qualities of 13 mega pixels are no worth of 5 mega pixelslenovo killer note 8 poor than lenovo vibe 5
super mobile
dont take this phonecamera is not good as of 13 mp specially front one is worstheating problem is occurred during little bit heavy use like on playing game and videosit is heated up drastically on callingi want to return it but amazon refused to take it backover all not good it is
as per commitment not received idea data 122 gb
so so
good phone in this price
in this price segment the most desirable phone for photoholics awesome camera configurationsbut heating problem is an issue that is to be considered otherwise marvellous one
screen was brokenasked to replace the set but didnt get any positive resonde
received with no issues and on time
phonecharger not working properly please exchange my phone
lots of issues with lenovo k8 vibe as there is network issue with this mobile if you put same sim card in other mobile it works fine but call doesnt get connected in lenovo mobile
it gets over heated during short usage plz dont go for it go for samsung or other product and its performance is very good no lag in between usage works perfectly thanks
great product

exlent
its very bad as said by some reviewers sound exp was very poor camera qualiy is awful hoping to get my return

its awesome
it hangs and camera effect less
awesome phonevery good experience
phone start up 10 mins only usebut phone over heat
phone is to good but heting
good mobile i need invoice for that phone kindly send my registered mail idneed urgent
lenovo k8 note venom black 4gb with new system update where is the system update we have to check the update only os 711 is updatednaught not oreo 81  then why you are mentioning it as with system updatethe purchase date of the mobile was 20092017 and the warranty expires in 8 days on 08june2018 when checked online on the lenovo product check official lenovo warrenty check
over all performance is good but phone is getting heated up when plugged into charging will suggest to go for redmi note 4 instead of lenovo k8
 primary camera not worthy cast screen not able to detect any smart tvs screen sharing option not available no parallel apps options unable wifi connections though strong wifi mobile data connection breaks for every minute screenshot option is pathetic many smart options which are available in budget phones are not available in this phone heating and hanging is another problem could not able to find call recording optionslooks to me most of problems can be resolved with appropriate updates and software enhancements so i will amend rating once lenovo address above issues if lenovo not keen to address basic issues then you will get better options even in budget phones also
i thought ill b getting earphones with the box but its just a phone
superbbb
excellent in all respect
finger print scanner has stopped working
ok
from the very next day the finger print lock sensor of the handset stopped working
network and battery heating prob
data cable of this product is not working
the product is not worth the money at all the battery backup is very bad and phone keeps on restarting frequently would like to get another product or refund
this lenovo divice is overheated while charging and while mobile data turned on
lenovo not give the task manager and camera is best but one speaker is not work and cellular network is very good
i use this phone i feel good
its deliver 1day prior to scheduled time which was nice specification says its a volte supported phone but in reality its not need to install a jio4gvoice if want to use jio sim in it for making and receiving calls cant make or receive calls on jio network if connected to wifi which is pathetic overall i am not happy due to all of these issues
great phone with the stock android its the smoothest phone that i have used till date the built quality is also descent and the front and rear cameras perform good this phone is for heavy users like me  and the 4000 mah battery is good enough for a full days work if you are looking for a phone that is all rounder in this range the k8 note is always a great option one thing that i left out is the sound quality which is good being backed by dolby atmos  this 4gb ram varient is very good although the 3gb ram varient has some issues  but this one is completely fine
very bad product from lenovo battery is overheating so much
i bought this phone in first sale i inserted one of my two mobile sims  then started updatingdownloading the application and then thought to insert the second sim when i tried to do so the sim slot was not opening at all i have raised the return request but unable to do so as no one is able to remove the sim card even mobile repairing shopscharging is not fastdual camera is better than regular 13 mpmobile is just okamazon team helped in refund process happy with amazon but i may not buy this phone again
lots of issues bo not buy this phone
super
not so goodexpected better productthe phone is little bit slow  battery is not that goodbrought at high pricelater price dropped
overall satisfied value for money no doubt in that but battery performance is not up to mark earlier was using panasonic eluga a2 with 4000 mah battery which will last whole day and will be about 34 25 balance charge but this one draining battery faster overall its good choice turbo charger also not giving any speed to change fast actually its taking 1 hour to 130 hours to charge full
lts very awesome handset and features are excellent and specially its easy to operate
camera not capturing picturesand the battery is like 2000 mah the mobile sucks waste of money expected alot from the lenovo but it failed
i am received the lenovo k8 note i am using this mobile eighteen days the main problem is battery draining is very fast battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours incoming calls not receiving at times even though full signal its consume very much memory heating issue comes after some hour use dual rear camera is not working always hanging this phoneits quality is too badnot something good for buyingalso amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund they are asking for some local app to check the phone which doesnt have battery checking option
the games start to lag a little bit after playing for a hour and gets heated up not expecting from new phone  dont know what happens when it gets old  but phone have rigid body  phone ram fills up to 75 sometimes not so handy while gamingand finally stop decreasing its cost it hurts us a lotüòÇüòÇ
phone is goodbest in classbut battery is not much like 4000
with respect to price and featuresthis is a perfect smart phone that anyone can have it
there is a heating issue in this device and finger print sensor does not work in 1st time
id say its a ok phone heating up like a hell otherwise its a ok phone if youre a gamer id recommend not to buy this phone
jhakass
fully satisfied with the product happy 
turbo charger is not working wellor camera picture quality is worse very disappointing 
after using 10days writingits awesome phone with powerfull batteryramdual camera everything k im happy with it
i purchased lenovo k8 note on 26th september its working good for two months suddenly problem arises didnt understand what happened suddenly phone getting discharged fastly and when i charge the phone it will take more time almost 6hrs to complete full charge and moreover phone is getting too heat while charging its not happened for first two months but its totally disappointedis there any chances in getting exchange to the product
waste of money
if you are looking for simple and sweet phone then go with this handset if you are a basic user like using normal whatsapp instagram nad few other apps in daily usage then it is good battery life is average camera is also average you can say it is giving the performance for the price which you are paying
nice phn
writing this review after eight months of using this phone this phone is very good in its build qualitysupereb front 13 megapixel camera with quit powerful front flash performance is very good i play a lot of games does not lag in gameingcons when talking about the cons of this product is that the bokeh mode and the blur effect is not very good just average same goes to battey backup just a bit less not as good as mi phones on heavy usage you have to charge it again in the evening
bluetooth is not working properly with my speaker getting breaking sound most of the time
nice mobile but some network issues detected
volume keys not working volume auto matically going to zeo and going to silent mode
dual camera didnt work100‚ÑÖcharging takes 45hoursturbo charge doesnt workwent to lenovo service centre they didnt solve my query i want solution for this problem 
very good phone ‚ô•Ô∏è
super
battery backup is not good full charge lasts upto 8 hours medium utilization camera quality is also not good sometimes hangs and heating issuedont buy at this price go for mi a1 similar configuration at 14999
phone are regularly heat and his temperature is continue to over heatvideo song is not clearly playbattery back up is very poor because phone are continue to heat in time of open mobile data and charging
good
dislikeenhanced 4g voltelte mode are not showing
the best product released by lenovowhich gives a excellent performance in gaming and multi tasking and the best feature in this phone is the split screen
excellent phone better than redmi note 4 it does heat up occasionally not every time and that too not that much battery performance is i would say above average as it lasts almost 1 day with 4000 mah battery performance is great no complaints with the phone loved it
best phone in this price range 10k  updated software removed all previous issue
good product
camera is awesome with in builth editing give somewhat professional looking photosbattery is average drain at faster speed same as turbo charging had high exception from battery using p1 iphone style sim ejector is annoyingoverall performance is smooth like makans smooth as fkcharger provided is not turbo its regular
not a good product heating problem n some softwear problem
battery still hitting when charging and fingerprint sensor hanging problem
best phone  camera quality is very good
the charger of this product is not working called amazon customer care but they are refusing to change it what the hell is this 
nice fone
i have not received the ear phones from the sealed box of lenovo
i am using it from past 8 months worst phonecast like basic function is not working
worst ever phone of my life dont purchase its horrible
this can be a good product if lenovo improves its depth camera battery life and not so good network connectivityotherwise cool productturbo charging takes 2 hrs to fully chargedepth camera looks like some sort of software tweak
very poor battery phone heats slot and take 25 hours to charge there is no turbo charging
ummaah to bolby atmos i love this device also due to stock android os bass is very detailed use 16 ohms earphones sennheiser cx 300 ii or cx 180 only as theyll give enough loudness i love its sound output audio output is 3 times better than my iphone motorola and lenovo are my permanent brands from now i regret for returning my moto g6 people are fools who buy any other brand when it comes to android os google should consider motorola phones as their flagship device
after 5 days of usage i find some issues in my lenovo k8 note whenever i install a new app i cant find the app in my app list when this happens i should restart my phone then only i can see the app in my app listnot only that whenever i use my share it and minimises it then i found some glitches on my lock screen and home screen also and this happen with asphalt 8 tooplease tell me someone that why this happens to my lenovo k8 note and what should i do thisis there anyone to know about this please tell me

good phone very good delivery from amazon
very bad mobile from lenovo pls dont buy battery backup is worst turbocharger wont work at all hangs sometimes camera is very slow overall bad phone
the battery backup sucksand the camera stops many times after continuous usage and if you want to use your camera again than you need to restart the phonethe flashlight is not good because it gives a yellow type color on picturesi have returned this itemnow im gonna buy tenor glets give a try to that new companyanyways i was a very old user of lenovoi dont why but their battery backup sucksthe display is not good when comes to watching videoand bluetooth is not at all good after updating the second  third updatetheir is a huge of cons which cannot be tolerated

best mobile
this mobile is too bad once you update i update my mobile then i face too much heating issue and mobile apps are not working and also there is battery drainage issue after oreo updation pathetic product by lenovo
ear phones not given
absolutely useless phone in this range pls dont go for it battery worst
nothing great in this phone except good battery life phone heats a lot function buttons at the bottom do not have backlight this is a big issue if you know sound is ok size is too big
its really really good phone with small price sound quality is very good i had tried many brands in past but none has worked out well for me thanks to amazon
product not soo good its ok and in this product gives dual camera but use only one camera main mobile over heat issue
heating issue
its heats up in short time  for charging its takes around 3 to 4 hour and worst part takes same time to drain without using it for whatsup  you tubeor gaming feels hot in hand holding phone more than 10 to 15 min feels scary too as if it will gets burst  long charging time huge issue
i bought this phone on flash sell for rs13999 now it is in the price range below rs12000 the reason is obvious very poor battery back up camera is below average finger sensor is staggering to recognise sometimes hanged to execute simple applications which ran smoothly in my earlier smart phone whose configurations are far below than this i assure what they promised actually is a total failure dont waste your valuable money into it i doubt whether the company can rectify or upgrade the performance by software upgradation the only positive think  is its look and screen size feeling sorry how amazon can promote this product with such vigorous advertisement
mobile is too bad and lot of network issue
good product with good packaging
fake dual camera depth mode is of no use its just edits the pic and the produced pic feeld like badly edited battery sucks heating problem no volte jio sim wont work unless you use jio app dual camera is fake even when you place you finger in front of the 5mp camera your phone will still take a blurred background pic which clearly says that the pics are edited and the 2nd 5mp camera is of no use
on offer this product is greatbut redmi note 5 is a good competitor of k8 note
battery is okay picture  and sound qualities are awesomeworth every penny
excelant
awesome phone at this price rangestock android is a bit annoying after using so many oem veraions but as time elapses you get used to it
nice productsome üîã issue
though battery life rating is high the cheap and slow mediatek processor lowers the battery capacity

good phone
i ordered this phone and it showed that they would deliver me the latest version of android 80 oreo they delivered me a old version and as well as the device was faulty i showed this phone to the lenovo service center they said that this device is faulty and suggested that we should return this back to amazon i then contacted the amazon customer care service but they refused to take the device back as the device return period was over which is completely accepted by me but these guys cheated on me as they delivered me a faulty piece and refused to take the phone back the phone does not catch the signal of the wifi even if the router is next to it i also have two tablets of lenovo they connect to wifi instantly from anywhere in the house this was happening because of the old 711 noughat version so i went to the lenovo service center and upgraded it to a android 80 oreo but then the condition became even worse and it also stopped getting signal i am not satisfied with my device and i want this faulty device to be taken back by amazon and return me my rs11650 the amazon has cheated on me as the return back policy does not allow me to make a replacement of this device i want amazon to tale back my device as soon as possible
lot of mobiles and other items purchase this is first time i will write bad review for product improve i am not tell totaly waste this mobile some disappoint points i observe last three daysfrequently restart mobile during large file or multi file selection copy or deletingover heat issues observe on trasparent cover because mobile produce tomuch heatcast screen not working

i have bought this phone from offline store next month in may it would be 1 year that i am using this phone the phone is good camera good in lighted areas speed is good battery is good but what has annoyed me the most is the temperature you charge the phone surf use social media play games do whatever it heats up so much that you wont be able to hold it i play games i use two usb fans connected to my laptop pointed at the back of the phone and a damp cloth to keep playing it heats up with in 5 minutes of playing any game when i charge i keep the fan running for just this one issue all the plus points of this phone goes down the drain in would not buy another lenovo and would not recommend buying k8 note

im using this phone from last 3 days based on my experience i can say that this phone is not worth of 14k phone is too bulky no premium look both front and back camera is ok but 2 much of waist of space in home keys i have observed heating also while playing youtube videos in this price range there r good phones available in market like lg q6 and nokia 6 feeling my hard earned money waisted i got exicited by looking into configuration but after receiving phone im too disappointed dont feel like using hand can give 2 star only for new processor n battrey
way too big and too heavy  more useful as a weapon or a hammer
good quality and good looking
no voice recorder
i expected backlight on touch buttons which is absent rest is gud
why the hell there is no gallery before i was using k4 note it was much handy and has super function in it
very bad hand internet not working in this set pathetic service
camera is too damn poorno volte no earphonesdidnt worth the money paid for
good worth the money
my data cable is not workingi bought this phone in the month of september from where i can get replacement

i bought this phone even though i am already having lenov vibe k5 note assuming this phone is the game changer but to my disappointment not much changes compared to lenovo vibe k5 note even though there a slight increase of 500 mah bettery life but you wont experience that increase while taking photo shot on the screen appear smaller than vibe k5 note but low light photos are slighly better in lenovo k8 note even some of the features are missing in lenovo k8 note like super battery save mode etc not that great buy

an okay phone nothing to make a wow feel battery drains very fast i dont know how does a 4000 mah lip battery drains like this cant stay with phone in on mode in night even if u charged 100‚ÑÖ in the morning camera is average processes very fast and no hang or delay in accessing apps and all i wont recommend this phone this is a genuine review after a 2 weeks very hard core use
excellent product which i was looking fora lenovo fan since last 1 decade
good value for the money but has some irritating issues like getting powered off while charging
nice phone in budget of 12000good network quality while calling in jio networkno need to mobile data on to calling by jio

i bought a k8 plus and it uses a 52v charger normal 5v charger does not work with the phone normal charger takes more than 16hrs to charge the phone if it charges at allplease check if this is a problem with k8 note
the worst cell ive ever used

super nice item
very bad and very poor software and more battery consumption tottaly very baf

lenovo k8 note phone is very bad networking problem network slots is very low quality

best
superfast experience with 23ghz deca core processor
i would recommend everyone to not buy mediatek chip enabled phones lenovo is still a very good company you can look for lenovo p2 the fastest charging on the world with the highest battery backup and with samsungs super amoled display and sony camera go for it without any doubtsand with the best chip ie sd 625 at only 13499 on flipkart
satisfaction guarantee
nice phone
good
if u r music lover dont buy this phone
phone is good but battery backup is not good
really awesome product
battery pick up
good
the phone is hanging maximum times and battery is draining rapidly than my earlier lenovo k8 notewhat is the reason i dont know
i am writing this review after 3 months of usage i received quite a number of software updates i am happy on that front the software experience is just fantastic it is currently running oreo the portrait mode is just ok nothing exceptional the camera modes are good too i feel the ram management could have been better coming to the main part the battery life is utter nuisance it doesnt hold up like a 4000mah battery if u r willing to purchase it for its battery please stay away i charged the battery to 80 percent in the morning at around 830 n found the battery to be 52 percent at around 4 pm the thing to be noticed is that the device was used not a bit it was idling the whole while the performance of the phone is very good it does get warm while charging and playing games but nothing unbearable
except camera i think rest of the other stuff is same like other lenovo phones i dont feel this phone have any extra ordinary quality look and feel is total low quality phonemoney waste dual camera is not workingworst phone by lenovoall the application suddenly stops working while using itif its the last phone on earth still dont buy lenovo claims deca core processor but performancene is lesser than the phone having four core processor
phone ok but some lag in gaming and camera not perform well may be software issue overall gud package little costly
good
good phone and excellent features for this price
its worst phoneamazon is the one reason to by this phone  amazon ad showsgood killer performancegood camera quality battery backetc its not worth for thisalready i have htc desire 816g  lenonvo is not worth for thatlenonvo is worst company they give a fake ads
bad phone
its got heating problem and finger print unlock is like only for phone and the 5 mp back camera is a drawback its not a water repellent phone lenovo doesnt have any water proof phone so dont buy this phone  i really had a bad experience with phone and service center peopleand if you go to lenovo service center for warranty these people will talk about their policies first instead of providing a solution  they cant solve any of your phone issue and they move on
not satisfied
worst phone ever seen for that price range waste of money
very good
dont ever buy this mobile because it does not have screen mirror feature even cheap mobiles have this feature
this review is a exact outcome of using this mobile for more than a monthpros and cons1 battery backup close to 2 days approximately including idle time internet and call usage so rest assured you are in good hands i have attached screenshot of my battery usagenote keep your mobile charge for at least 8 hours before the first time use2 turbo charge great as expected so yes it gives your cell more time in hand3 camera hdr feature really capture detailed images front camera with flash is a nice feature4 this phone works with 4g 3g and 2g speeds5 dual separate nano sim slot and additionally it has separate memory card slot for external storage you will never run out of storage issues6 fingerprint sensor response time is very faster and you can use the same for taking photos additionally you can use it as a app lock for unlocking important appsbut you have to install separate app from play store cons7 google personal assistant feature is awesome8 dedicated music key in left but you can also use this as a shortcut for few useful actions like taking screenshot and camera9 call management is really difficult need to download apps from play store for setting call waiting and etc cons10 voice recorder need to be downloaded separately cons11 hardware is really awesome but software needs lots of customization cons12 just double tap to awake the phone and you can see the time and date without unlocking it13 press the volume key and click on the bell symbol to put your phone on vibrate and silentthere should be some shortcut has to be provided for this cons14 design of this phone is an absolute killer15 cast screen option is only supported with chrome cast device so you cannot share anything with smart tv without this casting device conshowever you can play youtube videos from phone to smart tv with inbuilt youtube application which comes with castingoverall its a good phone and worthy for money you pay because it has lot customizations needed to be done and have to download apps for basic things so my rating is 4 stars
perfect mobile in this budget
mobile overheating not not backup in battery
overall nice performance
very comely phonegreat

the product i received is defective one of the two is not working left speaker is not working and right speaker is working i want to replace the product but the steps for returning the product is not proper on amazon it says to down load the smart check app i did that and run the app but the app says my product is good i called amazon and explained the issue he says to move to nearest authorised service center and get the letter that the product is defective dont know how the problem will be settled

lenovo always has great specs on paper and poor performance  stability in reallifethis is my 3rd  last lenovo over 6 years  k3 note didnt work well vibe had battery reboot issues and went to repair center twice now thisk8note issues1 very poor battery particularly with gps on it dies far more rapidly than samsung or any other phone2 poor drivers when i plug in the ear phone and remove them the normal speaker stops working cant hear voice on incoming calls needs reboot3 wifi is flaky connection drops suddenly picks up again4 hangs when multiple apps are opened suddenly you find you cannot even take incoming callsall this within 68 months of purchase of the phoneadieu lenovo i tried hard to like you
the killer notes killer indeed
using it since 2 weeks  no such lags or problems faced yet initially there were bugs which was solved with the provided update the dual camera setup is just a myth overall battery performance is awesome
after 15 days the charger had stoped working and no complain had been taken regarding it for me worthless phone
dear sir when i use mobile from delivery date 8 0ct2017 charging is not 100 we can turbo charger pinned properly full day charging bt not complete 100 whypls i request help me and provide good service

waste brand lenovo not value for money products
good mobilesolid build multitasking is so buttery ram management can be better lenovo need to work on this battery backup is better after the recent september security patchdual camera setup is just a gimmick the dept mode is just waste of time and money single primary camera from both front and back take decent pics camera app definitely need improvementthe capacitive buttons are not backlit but didnt faced any issues in darkthe most annoying thing about the mobile is suddenly a popup raises and says amazon app is not responding or some other x app is not responding and sometimes i am not able to launch some heavy apps after installing from google play storemobile heatsup only while charging didnt faced issue while playing games like asphalt air borne war robots but there were frame drops while playing war robots
powerful phone
nice
reasonable pricebetter phonefast deliverythank youamazone
excellent product
good phonelot of improvements in camerahowever battery back up is bad compare to earlier lenovo phone like vibe p1 turbo k8 note lacks feature of restricting auto start of apps which was there in earlier phones hence battery drains fast in k8 notethough turbo charging but it takes almost 2 hours to full chargealso one of the most irritating thing is notification volume is same as ring volume which disturbs your routine because if you keep ring volume high then notification sound is also highno schedule power onoff featurewe expect some addon features by lenovo to overcome these issues
every thing seems good except the battery life
there is some issues in the phone in status bar time is not updating properlysound quality is bad i think its software issue it vary time to timeheadphone sound is not buzzing
lenovo k6 power is better in many ways than the k8 note like low budget 999910999 good speaker sound  more loud  clear sound than k8 note with dual speaker back side k8 note has only 1 speaker at bottom more battery backup with same 4000mah battery k6 powers battery consumption is very less than k8 note you can use k6 powwr for more hours than the k8 note with full charged battery comfortable size 5 screen easily fit in pocket free inbox earphones in k8 note earphones are not provided more features than k8 notek6 power lounched 6months before lounching of k8 note but still itk8 note doesnt have functionality which k6 power already hasfunctions which is not in k8 note are as follows1 wide touchto lock phone shortcut for many recent app its just like apple button2 quick snap double tap volume button to take screen shot3 smart scene to open any action by time or by on connecting any device like wifi etc by this function you can set your brightness low for night time by set action time 800 pm  700 am or silent your phone between office hours automatically many other things4 fingerprint snap you can take photos by touching fingerprint sensor5dual app profile two whatsappfb account simultaneously6 quick flashlight by tapping home button twice7 secure zone guest mode in secure zone you can install same apps with different account and that apps can only work when you open secure zone with password
the phone seems alright with just about 2 weeks of using it i did come across an error with the phoneprocess stopped responding and i had to restart my new phone hangouts is another app that just crashed when i started using it on this phone lastly the battery is not exactly living up to the expectations of being a 4000 mah battery else the features look audio camera are all good its quite smooth is handling itthere is no headset that comes along with this handset
awesome
good product in this prise rangei found camera quality is good as compare to other phones in the same prise range display is also good sometime phone gets heat after using for long time maybe because the processor

heating and network problem
1 dual stand by 4g2 not good camera redmi note 4 has same issue3 stock android but needs to be optimized and should have better rambattery managementuser can choose k8 note or redmi note 4 both are fine if one ask you to choose fromredmi note 4 has plus for the miui and its customization while k8 note has bit tiny better on paper specs 13mp selfi camera
super
camera is not good
not at all recommended my lenovo k8 has the following issues1 poor signal strength  tried different sims like vodafone jio etc but signal shows only 23 bars whereas the same sims when inserted in other 4g handsets it shows full strength n no call drops2 heating problem the company has added 4000 mah battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly on using simple daytoday work it gets heated like anything and the full battery drains within half day
lenovo k8 note looks good but from last morning it has started getting onoff in every second i am not able to either switch it off or on
courier waste very very very worst
battery backup is not good mobile is so hot
it is an awesome mobile at this price all features are awesomes i liked it
i am utterly disappointed with the brand itself the k series was hyped up due to its packed specifications but this particular mobile went down the drain in less than 6 monthsthings i want to specify about this mobile1 the mobile is quite heavy not pocketfriendly2 picture quality is average for dual rear camera and the front camera isn‚Äôt good either3 the mobile heats up real fast while watching a video or in a call4 at some point the turbo charging stopped working it took forever to charge it back5 i don‚Äôt like the resolution of the phone eitheri‚Äôve given away my mobile to the customer service hope it survives better not go for this mobile
the phone is good however the bluetooth is flaky at times
in promotion they said it has gorilla glassbut today my mobile got big scrach on the screen just i kept in my pocket this product does not have gorilla glass

no internal app like music player vedio player app lock app battery app heard to take screen shot reare camera is so bad
except battery backup every thing is ok
charging back up is very bad
worst phone it takes at least 1015 seconds to unlock thru finger print even power button also takes few seconds to open the screen for unlock while talking on phone if you have to see some thing like any message then it takes 56 seconds for screen lights to come up once you move it away from your ear never buy this worst phone operating system is pathetic
very good device in this price segment much better than cheap redmi phonesmediatek x23 deca core processor beats snapdragon 625 in almost every department
amazing phone very good battery backup up as well as clarity of camera is very good compare to other brands good competent for vivo and in less price
touch is not working properly battery recharge sometime slow
charging more than 5 hours is called turbo charging worst experience amazon seller kindly tacke immediate action

very bad mobile
there is no phone which can beat it at this rangeno redmi vivooppobest

ok super
yesi had great expectations while buying this post review but turned out to be a thumbs downwhile lenova k8 note comes with amazing configuration it could not stand out to my previously used mi note 3 which i bought for 9k 2 years back battery backupcamera features sound quality music and video apps  swiftness  call quality were all below average
nice mobile below 10k rangebattery life is really long lasting not lagging though i have fulled my memory n install more than 150 appscons screen mirroring is only with google chrome
product quality is not as good as it describes because camera is extreme bad and phone heating problem
best phone in this price rangenice camera quality front and rear both are best at itbright hd displayfast processing no lagginggood battery lifego for it 
worst mobile in my life time
i am not a vivid user of a lot of phones however looking at the feature i went for this one as of now i am happy with the decision the phone does not heat up has a great speed and cameraonly feedback is to provide headphones with the pack considering the sound output the phone delivers user like me get confused on which phone to buyoverall m happy with the decision
not to reach expectations
very poor cameranot expected from lenovobattery drain very fasti brought it because i thought it could be double standard than k4lenovo id degrading day by day
no speed dial in this phone no inbuilt call recorder which are available in lenovo lower model sound is not good camera clarity is not at par as company claimed some futures are very tough to find battery after 15 phone shutting down not a big deal not suggest to purchase
its heating problem while charging and updates also videos playing battery not expecting charging time also take time around 2 hours full  and medium speed ram work not overall expecting compare lenovo k8
dable camera dikhavati he
wonderful camera but the turbo charger is not effective

what are all the pros and cons of this device watch the full review vs redmi note 4 on my utube channel denniscnlew  also watch the durability bend test and splash test
but bekar amazon sarvis meri mano koi saman mt mgao isse flipcard best
not good while use the in just 15mints getting heatbattery also not good it is fastly drainedbut charge is super within 30 mnts fully charged
camera is very bad front and rear both are like cheap mobile after oreo update battery drain issue in 25 hours and turbo changer charging timing is 5 hours heat like a electric iron automatic restart problem major lags sometimes only speakers are good fake promise of gorilla glass as it get scratches easilyand most importantly stock android sucks look like a idiot designed and planned for stock androidi wasted my money you guys better go for huwai or mi far better than lenovo and motoroladont buy by reading paid reviews
amazing phone worth for 12999
good phone
over all phone is good  turbo charger is not actual turbo we can it is fast charger only  phone lacks in rear camera quality  in low light performance is very poor  bhokeh effect is not working okay  if u want to buy it for photography dont go for it  u can get better option cool 1 dual as better option for photography i am using both phones
phone is average not as lenovo promised there is no turbo charging sometimes it lags too and camera quality is also normal touch and screen is impressive in my views it is just an average phone not something to hype about
head phone is missing in the box
very worst product amazon delivering unworthy items
lenovo k8 note venom black 4gb
best buy with maximum features  performance
so apparently if your charger cable degrades you have to shell out rs 1500 to replace your mobile charging port too why you ask because they can not connect phone to pc using broken cable not any other working cable because that is against their policy so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty i am amused how many ways people come up with to cheat customers
got the product within 2 days excellent phone the packaging could have been better recommended for all

nice phone great battery backup n camera thanks to amazon
lenovo k8 note quality issue very disappointed i purchased lenovo k8 note on 18th august 2017 i was very disappointed to find that whenever i stream videos online or download videos from internet the videos lacks sharpness and accurate colour reproduction even at higher resolutions the videos are unwatchable but the same videos look perfect when they are transferred to internal memory of the phone or sd card via a computer or any other storage drive even the videos shot on lenovo k8 look perfect the quality issue occurs only when you stream or download videos from the internet such poor quality control from lenovo is just not acceptable also the led notification light doesnt work with whatsapp messenger facebook etc it only activates when you have an unread sms email and missed calls it does not work with any other app there is no such thing as fast charging in this phone even though it is mentioned on the box the 4000 mah battery takes more than 2 hrs to charge and if you are using the phone while charging then it may take indefinite time to charge completely moreover the battery drains so quickly that you may think you are using a 2500 mah battery phone just lasts for 34th day even with casual to moderate use beaware guys if you are going for this phone be ready to compromise on video viewing quality basic functions of led notification light battery life and battery charging time
heating
nice phone
the phone screen is flickering while playing videos on youtube or while playing games are you guys selling damaged goods in this sale going to return the product

bad product
i purchased lenovo k8 note on feb 22022018not satisfied with the product since i got some technical problem
worst phone that i have been using issue with touch sometimes sound not clear takes lots of time to start worst of all is the contact list is completely jumbled i call a person and and you hear a different person answering the callonly good thing is charges very fast and as of now stays for the whole day
nice mobile
now it is good
not bad
one of the speaker is not workingeven battery is not up to the marknot happy at all
i am not a big fan of lenovo but i was compelled to buy this product due to its specs at a reasonably low rate and i was correct lenovo has done nly one thing rite to quire motorola and that can only save them i am using lenovo k8 note for past 1 month andi have started getting issues like heating  at times too slow for the basic use itself these cons can be accepted but for the past few days i am getting issues with charging it cahrges for few minutes then automatically it stops really a bad experience with phone with usage of 1 month only
initial review 22aug2017ive been using this phone for last 3 days so this is kind of initial review buying experience and delivery was crisp thanks to amazon prime amazing1 the design is not a eye catcher but nothing wrong about it either2 the camera is ok and nothing impressive low light photography is grainy3 heating is a serious problem it gets hot after long usage not unbearable but not desirable either4 os is nice and close to stock addition of some moto sw makes it even better5 no lag or performance issue so far4 display is good but on the dimmer side would loved to see a brighter display6 battery back up and fast charge work fine7 sound through good earphone is above the price rangeverdict before jumping into conclusion you might want to consider lg q6 and to be launched nokia 6 or better redmi note4                                                                                       update1  25aug2017its been a week since im using this below is the update in addition to my initial review1 the phone battery drains fast compared to the capacity and it hardly lasts a day2 the bokeh effect is not something worthy lot of manual stabilization and patience is required to get a good shot3 heating problem continues and it seems a permanent issue4 poor os optimization and thus not suitable for heavy gaming plus the heating issue5 works fine with jio volte both for calls and dataverdict hype is not delivered
good
it is super
this phone has heating issue in only 10 days from purchase date
very very poor product by lenovo  it hasnt been working at all i purchased less then a month before its not working at all

it comes with gorilla glass which can break esasyly even in low pressure on it
k4 note users dont buy this as this is not an upgrade of k4 note this interface is different and many features which are in k4 note are missing in this
very good product nice smooth performance thanks mediatek for high speed processor those who ever wants can buy with out hesitation
phone good with good features but not having a headphone with it is the biggest turnoffs that just seems cheap on lenovos part not to add in the headphones the fm application is useless without the headphones

dear amazon  lenovoi purchased this phone as a gift for my father who is 70 yrs hoping that the large screen and its ease of operation would help him right from the start after receipt of the phone my father kept complaining that there is a problem with the phone as screen does not respond  wake up if locked or notify an incoming call so he is only able to hear phone ring but not able to receive the call i thought it was a settings issue but when we took to lenovo service center at prime mall irla vile parle w mumbai on 18 oct 2017 the service center representative said that we should have returned the product in 15days and then took in phone for software reload my father spent rs 700 for backing up  reloading data after this software reload the product worked ok until 27 oct 2017 and then the same incoming call issue has reoccurrednow my father who is 70 yrs old is sick of this phone and this problem and doesn‚Äôt want itkindly assist in the matter please
i received phone quickly  short time good work
camera awesome touch perfomance goodsound quality is best but where is defaut gallery where is clipboard where is defaut music player too weight190gram
this product doesnt meet all the expectations it created at the time of launching1 processor and camera is good no buffering while watching videos in you tube  live tv  dedicated portals of tv network2 trendy look easy handling and lenovo could have provided headsets in the accessory kit that was missing3 turbo charging was good initially after couple of months it started deteriorating from its set standards it takes time min of 130 hrs for 20 when the battery capacity is at 804 battery life is not as expected for 4000 mah for a non gamer with limited default apps it should last for more than a day when used fully under mobile data but battery drains out quickly5 ear piece volume there is a problem in all lenevo mobiles that while on call near by person can hear the voice of other person its very pathetic when it comes to whatsapp calling it gives us a feel like we put our mobiles on speakers the volume is too loud even though the same is kept at least level lenovo technical team should pay more attention on this set back6 audio output  could feel dolby atmos effect only when we keep our palm near speakers else this feel is missing completely its because of single outgo at the bottom of the device due to which this feature got misfired i believe tested this feature specifically with dolby atmos effect videos which is widely available in web pages7 otherwise got this mobile on deal so when compared with other models i got the device for what i have paid for i should compromise myself in that way8 could feel heating issues when mobile data is used continuously for more than 25 minutes or during on a call for more than 15 minuteshope this review helps
i received damage phone please arrange returned

satisfied
after 2 month when i charge my phone it will be heat 
lenovo ki note nice looking but network catch not better than redmi note 4 average heating problem
nice product
doesnt look like gorilla glass broke multiple times
lenovo k8 note is the perfect mid range phoneplus it has got stock android and regular updatesi bought the 4 gb variant venomous blackpros1stock android2good display big display3good design4nice speakers5decent front and back camera ill come to the second camera later6can play resource intensive games easily7has no dirty skins for andoid so the performance is mid blowing for a mid ranged variant8 awesome costo
what i think  this phn is excellent but in just 15 days mobile is heating very high whenever i charge or switch on the internet mobile is heating very bad experience
missing the pin to open the sim card
must buy mobile phone and good service by flipkart
i am used 7 month mobile lenovo k8 note is very good phone and smart my phone apdated but my phone android 80 verson and taken time my mobile android 711 very very nice my phone
camera is not having good additions in it
awesome performancesuper battery lifesuper rear and front camera clarityawesome gaming experiencecompletely price worthy product
worst mobile heats up battery drains out in 2 hours use takes 10 hours in charging money wasted
nice cell phone
its good but i am not available to understand how works dual camera because i checked by finger touch on camera but i think uper camera is not working so we how to say dual camera phone other wise its ok
volte option doesnt work while in power saving mode other than that the phone works fine
i will not recommend this phone  its battery back up is poor and video quality doesnt match with the same end phonesi want to suggest buyers who are planning to buy this phone dont buy this  instead of k8 note go for k8 plus k8 plus and k8 note has small difference in specs but very big differences in performance k8 plus has good battery life and last for almost 1 day after heavy use in my case k8 note has same 4k mah battery but drains very quicklygaming experience quite nice on k8 plus and k8 note bothno lags k8 note has some heating issue while charging but k8 plus has very minor or no heating problemsi have both the phones and among both of them k8 plus seems good to methank u
a real great phone fully developed lenovo technology good to buy this
dual camera is not working any way good amazon services is good
looks and works goodbut consumes lot of bactoryneed to charge twice a day
i saw 2 problems in mobile 1 i found no gallery in mobile 2 it takes too much time to delete pics from file manager rest lenovo k8 note is wonderful
great smoother phone but sometime hit and camera quality average
no voice and call record options
i lost my phone within 1 week in goa and goa police calangute police station dont support to search my phone
price low why i bought 13999 nd 5 days after it 11999
battery quality and back up is really awesomecamera quality is also goodscreen resolution is attractivebuttons are a bit hard but fine enoughspeaker quality is above parreally nice buy option among budget phones
best mobile in this price
am not get 15off discount
the phone hangs and restartsapparently it is something to do with the software update quite ridiculous because one would expect the phone to perform better with an update when the memory is half unused and that there are not many applications
awesome mobile at this price good battery backup super camera clarity  flash on both front  back huge memory 64gb inbuilt  4gb ram  also dedicated memory card slot dual sim every thing is good but tempered glass is not fit for the curved finish display so can be rated 4
everything thing is perfect but it is having 2 major problems1 secondary camera and boke effect is zero performance its nothing there just a marketing strategy2bluetooth is not working properly getting struck while playing audio through bluetooth and even when we switch the bluetooth on it wont connect fast it will tries to connect all other devices which are not in rangehave connected in past if we click on particular bluetooth device also it wont responds correctlyplz try to rectify itotherwise its a very good product for this price
nothing to go awww with the specs neither the phone is dudmusic  camera nothing exciting music is strictly ok camera is decentsoftware few glitches in the software we cant see the battery percentage no provision for night eye care view k6 note hadgaming avoid if you are a gamer and like to play for 23 hrs daily phone gets heat up above 40 degrees also i saw lags in phone while playing basic gamesspeed if multiple applications are runned than there is chance that phone will get slightly slowdisplay superb at this price tagoverall review nice phone but could have been way better had lenovo used sd625 chipset they should not had compromised on chipsetstill not a bad purchase just get your priority rightupdate please dont buy this device that is my humble request to all
value for moneygood product
the inbox accessories had earphone missing in it nice way to cheat 1000 rs from customers never expected this worst
looking nicegreat camera but battery is bad  set is being over heat
pricing issue device is not up to the expectation
battery backup is very worstreally am very disappointed for this phone memory for 4gb ram and 64gb internal memory and separate memory card slot is goodall specifications r good except battery 
phone is working gr8
happy
im writing this review after using the mobile for 1 month b4 this phone i have used k3note that was far better in performance than this mobile its worth buy if you get it below 10k not recommended for 12k
very bad
excellent
this mobile is same as other mobile this mobile having hanging problem and it is heating like a cooker while i turn on the wifi or mobile data and the camera quality is not as much good nothing special disappointed the expectations
worst phone i never seen this type of phone if i use this phone continuous 15 minutes getting heat battery capacity mentioned was 4000 mah but its value is 1000 mah worst battery backup no default music application and no default gallery application i recommended you people dont purchase if we go service center no proper response from those guys
nice and this feature are already in the moto but in this less gesture but ok

best mobile ever  best performance of camera processor also very fast and battery performance also good
ridiculous phone absolute terrible that amazon sells this heat pad as a phone it heats up first time you charge it has a billion bugs so disappointed had to sell mine immediately after buying deca core but still lags network issues jio sim issues heavy at 180 grms cant get over the bad experience i had please save yourself the trouble and dont buy it
i am using this phone over a 3month and i am facing to much of problems like1 worst battery backup2 loss of so many features3 if u had a brain better dont buy this product
very poor battery does not even last for a full day on normal usage the 4000mah battery on the redmi 4 lasts for two days almost with normal usage this phone is definitely not comparable to the redmi 4 this is no killer note the supposed to be fastturbo charger is a normal charger takes over 3 hours to charge the battery from 15 to 100 disappointed totally

worst battery performance
duplicate productvery worst product

its awesomeits camera  androidsizecolorsound everything in this is fab üòçüòç
ausome product  delivery service
camera quality is superbbattery perfm is goodproblem is it heat up after a 3060mins net surfing or playing high graphic games
previously i had oppo f1s that ran games smoothly and it had 3 gb of ram this k8 note has 4 gb of ram but games like war robots is lagging in this phone i feel very bad for buying this phone worst
after installation of recent update the phone is heating up very fast and the battery goes down in a jiffy from 100 to 0 i think the update is faulty same problem is seen in all k8 notes
nice phone
there is no headphones with the device and no option to use a customized ringtone you have to use the pathetic and irritating ringtones and alarm from this device very very disappointing
great battery great performance and front flashlight was coolbut it depth camera not work properly
nice phone
lenovo k8 note venom black 4gbi am very upset when i face network related issue in this handset i generally use idea network that is my amazon linked mobile number when i inserted micro sim it has worked instantly but since 3 days i didnt connect to anyone else via calling1 network signal up  down2 sometimes signal not showing3 didnt connect call generally i tried more than 2 times4 but all other things very good like software  configuration5 design not good as compare to other
nice mobile very fast everything is best
prosi purchaseed the 4gb64gb variantdelivery was fastdevice got deliverd one day before the promised timeconssignal reception issue on airtel4g im missig all my calls since i placed my airtel sim card to lenovo k8 note that too when im using a single primary sim and other slot is emptytried restartingaeroplane mode on off spoke to airtel customer care alreadynever faced such issues on my previous honor6charging the device takes too much time almost 3 hours from 10 to 100 only charges fast is the phone is offgoing to sell the device on olx if amazon or lenovo dont provide any solution to signal reception soonback camera quality is too poorforget the dual camera usage even on singal back cam the images are blurry and takes time to focusexpected better for a 13999 fone from lenovo
dont buy k8 software bugsthis is my 1st negative feedback there are issues with notifications contacted tech support team to whom even making the problem understood is a herculean task so you can forget about resolution only answer available is escalating team work shall revert at earliest hope we all know what such responses mean i am disgusted with lenovo they claimed k8 to be killeryes it would kill your want to use smartphone dont waste your time and money on a half cooked phone released in hurry to counter nokiai repent buying it and thought it prudent to warn the fraternity of potential buyersrajiv pathakrajivpathak27gmailcom
nice and excellent working on it
its an amazing product at this price the only thing i found lacking is the internet connectivity and the battery back up though it claims to have 4000 mah back up but with frequest browsing and talking it gets exhausted very fast there is no lagging the phone responds to your type request very fast and the google assistant is saviour over all a good phone to go ahead with
there was only one charger in the box where as they mentioned dual chargers of 15w
amazing

this phone doesnt feel like a 4000mah phone even my lenovo vibe k5 note gave better backup than k8 notethe ram doesnt feel like a 4gb ram either even when you dont have any apps running the ram usage is highprice wise this is decent but there the specs on paper and the performance dont match up with each otherunless lenovo optimise the performance and send in an update my recommendation would be dont buy

super
prosgood batterystock androidvery smoothconsbad dual camera probably a fix with software updatesometimes overheats
pros  good operating speed sufficient battery life and speakers satisfying display quality front camera s goodcons  rr camera is not up to the expectation  cannot feel the impact of dual cameras and picture quality is very poor not smart enough  very limited customization options lack of some basic apps  gallery  music players etc
nice product with best packaging
not so good many main features are missing like1 call recording and not third party app support2 blair effect in camera not so good3 auto screen sleep when flip cover used4 not satisfied with front flesh light5 take much time with other charger lke usb power bank expect charger with that6 screen too good7 multiple windows a good feature in that one8 speakers only lower side strep and dolby average9 overall average and upgrade model leg from previous numbers like k4 note10 honor 9i is batter one
the delivery was good which as usual from amazon but the phone screen glass is very fragile it is not the break resistant i had my phone a small fall from about 2 ft and the glass broke to replace i have to shell out about 5k i havent expected this from the so called gorilla glass it is not gorilla glass 3 gen and hence be careful it is not meant for even little rough use
after two days of receiving the device started acting up touchscreen went wrong apps started opening automatically if you press one digit several other digits automatically pops out dont buy this phone i am asking for replacement but i dont knw the replaced device will be ok or not dont buy lenovo phones review continue 20917 i got the replaced product and its more horrible battery is not at all getting charged its taking 8 hours to charge 70 and after browsing for 10 mins battery will drain very fast and the phone becomes a fireballso finally i have asked for refund and thanks to amazon that they too agreed for the same
recieved just now im fully satisfied with this mobile thanks to amazon for your great delivery
after a few days left side speaker stopped working all of a sudden i didnt think i will be delivered such defective products from amazon really disappointed 
bluetooth audio has intermittent noise battery of 4000mah only is good for numbers not in terms of long lasting device operationpoor power management to blame my earlier mi max 2 with 5300mah gives 3 days battery this one if it was equally good in power management should give at least 2 days but barely lasts a day  dont buy this

charging cable is of poor quality within 2 months of purchase  it was not charging  service centre in bangalore did not give free replacement during warranty period on flimsy ground of liquid damage all contacts in cable should be watermoisture proof for robust qulality think twice before buying

lenovo k8 doesnt support smart tv or any where u need to do casting
awesome performer smartphone till date
i bought it in august and within 2 months i had to rush to the service center to get the battery checked thank god it was still in warranty period after an update battery started to drain profusely suddenly it was taking 410 hours to get fully charged it wasnt so before the service center people say theyll call you once they fix your phone trust me they dont the phone was okay for a while the charger had a problemthen again while charging the phone i was using it maybe for once and bam the charger got damaged i had used htc before and used it while charging nothing ever happened again i rushed they charged some amount to get the charger cord fixed now its working fineproblems1 it heats a lot cant use it without cover your hands will feel really warm if you dont2 cant send messages from jio imagine3 its volte but on the status bar it says lte stupid4 very heavy heavier when you use tempered glass to protect the screen and you wont get right kind of glass for the curved edges hence though the screen looks really premium you have to use a flat tempered glass with no curved edges it ruins the actual look5 be prepared to be amazed if you didnt know stock android phones dont have gallery other than google photos no option for including ringtones no theme hardly any variety in the wallpapers and no customization
good phone at this price segment though it lags for heavy gaming sessions but apart from gaming and all regarding only about the performance this was good at this price got it for 12k camera also seems pretty decent
camera quality nt so good overall is good
good
front camera not satisfaied
this mobile phone is having problem found handset is not switch on please rectify my problem and change the handset
this model having so many problembattery becomes too hot within using five minute sometimes very very slow charging and takes 6 to 7hrs for full charging it takes long time while restart phone battery drains fast act like 3000 mh while my previous lenovo a6000 having better battery backup than this phone it takes long time while connect with data networknight camera is also not goodonly good thing in this phone having very good processor and very smooth touch screen and good speaker leaving this other all things are bad in this phone
battery backup is less than a day  and dual camera has some bugs 
good condition butwe reset the phone the turbo charger is cancelled
mobile looks very sexy and its features are very nice camera is great but most importantly a good mobile phone at a lower price

lenovo k8 note for great front camera good rear camerabokeh effect is good only in well lit conditions very good performance better battery
camera is great both front and rear similar to v5plus and oppo selfie but only android version is there no user interface so no customization option i say no you cant even change ringtone nd no applocker inbuilt
pathetic mobile no sound getting hang after updating to oreo 8
when it was new it worked well but now after 2 months it horrible camera doesnt open many apps crashdepth mode is not working properlyi have visited the service centre got temporary solution but then again same issue
trying to call also phone is getting hanged just 1 month old mobile dont go with lenovo k8 note
worst product amazon doesnt even refund easily even though mobile is not working properly worst experience ever with manufacturer as well as seller
the features are excellent but the usability isnt there despite a 10core processor 4 gb of ram it hangs out quite frequently i have an old huawei honor 6 3 gb ram  2015 model which is better than the new device also applications keeps on crashing quite frequentlycamera is of not good use too the pixel clarity is inefficient as it gets blur upon zooming after clicking of photographs also the time taken for saving the picture is 3 seconds after the click which is quite high as i have never used such a slow camera in any phonebattery life is good with constant data frequent calling and mail checks it runs for 810 hrs also turbo charger is a great advantagespeakers are another strong point in the phone the sounds are great means comparable or better than my vaio laptopthe phone boosts of gorilla glass but got scratch within a week of use while keeping it in pocket onlylenovo doesnt have any gallery or music player apps so had to download it from google play which again either comes with advertisements or i need to purchase those hence i am stuck with the advertised versions of basic apps also had purchased new system updates still had to update 2 gb of updates in total 3 times still oreo update would be available only in junejulythe worst part is i had gifted it to my wife and now what i got in return is the complaints part that too all the time means despite spending 10k approx this device does not fulfil its advertised words
full had vedio not playing properly and also sounf break when connected to bluetoothnot prepared to purchase
worst phone ever purchased
best mobile with excellent features and performanceturbo charging is one of the best features
what the hell is this i buy a lenova k8 note before 2mnth now this condition is very worst charge dry very fast and charging is very slow and heat over produced very very worst mobile
very cool phone easy to handle with almost complete features and specification
awesome
i dont find this phone worththe phone does not work as lenovo claimed they used dual in depth camera turbo charger as a gimmick should go for honor 6x for best alternative for this phoneram management processor and ram management is very good the phone does not lagcamera an awful camera dont know why its camera app decreases the quality of the imagethe camera will really let you downcharging it takes around 2 hours and 30 mins to charge completely from 15 which is a lot if the company claims for turbo chargerphone size  weight there is some extra space at top and bottom which ruins phone handling experiencesock android it is the only thing which is goodnetwork issue after switching my sims to this phone having the issue of the phone going not reachable
camera was not clear
ghatiya productbattery bahut jaldi discharge ho rhi phone heat karta h  lenovo ne ye kya product nikala haur amazon ke customer care executive wo aur mahanamazon se kuch kharidna hi nahi chaiye
good not better
please refrain from getting cheated by buying this phone in the form of a stock android os this phone has regressed a great deal from the previous k series phones it does not have many important features like long screenshot etc and screen castingmirroring is only possible if you buy chromecast device separately the menus have changed from the previous version and are very user unfriendly lenovo has taken a big step in alienating loyal customers by releasing this substandard phone to our markets and i caution all potential buyers to beware or end up feeling cheated like i am
k8 note satisfied when compared to same range mobiles in market slightly dissatisfied with cam quality rest all okpros good battery capacity 4000mahdual rear camerascons non removable battery and weights about 180 gms little heavier
this phone is not truly dual sim 4gand after updating it with android 8 it is totally wastage of moneyheating problem slow charging digital dolby sound is gone mobile data tab is not working battery backup is very poordrvsingh
good
good
this phone after getting the oreo update is completely useless it gets heated like a pan you can literally cook dosa on the phone lags like snail turbo charge takes 7 hours to charge when contacted the lenovo customer care about the issue they are even clueless of the issue and asking me to wait for official update from lenovo which they are also not sure when it will be released if you buy the phone dont damn update the phone with new software use it with the stock os android nougat 7x version
battery life is crap rest is ok
good product could have been better
very good phone in both of two camera front camera also awesome but rear camera can take photo with blur sound quality also good with dolby atmos music key works good ovearl in this price range lenovo k8 note is a good performance phone i love my phone
good mobile
bad product
excellenti have been using it for a long time now simply amazing battery is goodcamera is fine toooverall pretty satisfying at this price
screen mirroring option is not availablespeakers quality is not goodcamrea result bad
camera is very very very poor dont trust this its say 13mg pixel but pics are very poor in quality when u zoom into a pic the photo gets blurred its not up to the mark  my opinion out of 10 i give 2 rank for camera over all performance is gud but camera is very bad not even expected of such a low quality camera
nice product
nice mobile good touch nice look good performance the only one thing is battery drain is fast after 4010 mah
third class mobiledo no buy
nice
price worth mobile
ordered this phone for my wife after buying lenovo k6 power  design is good but speaker sound surprisingly disappointing no where near to k6 power came to know that turbo charger is not actually a fast charger boom  another surprise verified camera and its nothing great compared to the way it is marketed overall feeling little disappointed considering i was expecting it better than k6 powerrecommendation nothing great you can skip this one and wait for mi pro 2 or more reviews of moto g5 plus
nice phone i was using this phone more than three weeksthere is no issue still i found
it is better then my expectations
i have brought this product in oct 2017  but from six month i am facing the heat issue in charging and calling  from 2 month managing to work with thisbut its become worst condition now phone is in warrently anyway to exchange this product
value for money
not good
nice piece though very crudely packed timely delivered
faulty piece received facing problem in touch screen keypad operating automatically apps call history dialling pads etc opening itself even not touching to the handset bad experience of purchasing through amazon
worst phone ever never going to buy lenovo products ever brought this phone 2 months ago and i was quite happy with the performance initially but yesterday it was just fell off the bed and the display cracked it cost me 52k for new display so overall i had paid 20k for this phone which i dont think it worthbut i had no option suggest everyone to stay away from lenovo products lenovo may offers you high configuration phones  reasonable rates but believe me guys their maintenance is way expensive god bless lenovo consumers good luck
awesome üòòüòòüòò
good
not a good phone its not even been 1month completed there a damage with the phone phone is getting over heated i want the phone back and neither i will pay the amount i took it for emi
no dual camera just a showcase
overall the phone is very good but heating issue stops you from playing heavy games or apps

battery problem
i purchase this phone after many researchescamera is best at this price pointbattery fhd display is goodalmost everything is finebut some cons are there alsousable memory is less than half of 32gbphone takes a lot of time to startexcept this the phone is best and really a killer note
turbo charging taking 6hours to get full charge while device is on and taking 3hours to get full charge while device is switched off then after battery is draining like anything im not a heavy user but this phones battery draining in just 20hoursi feel im wasted my money on this deviceim not going to trust lenovo anymore n moreover ill spared my experience and discourage my folks towards lenovo products
nice phone k8
this is an really faster than snapdragon 625every app opens fastbut the bokeh effect is very poorvery bad bokeh effect selfie camera best
great
very nice mobile
battery back up not good
very poor handset please take it back
phone overheats way too quick 4000 mah battery barely stays 23 of gaming i used redmi note 5 pro before this same 4000 mah battery but note 5 can handle 56 hours of gaming easily lastly turbo charging is joke 10  100 in 2 hours 30 mins most of the time
sometimes getting heat  remaining everything good
good product but bokeh effect not works well otherwise acceptable
not so good
very nice phone
good phone in affordable cost with all features
camera was so clarity battery stands long time
good product
good phone on many aspects but lacks on some basic day to day requirements such as no inbuilt recording facility of voice calls no video calling doesnt connect to jabra halosmart bluetooth
verry bad
not able to open gallery
after 5 days of usage turbocharging stopped workingnow it takes about 6 to 7 hrs to get fully charged camera is normal not so goodtotally disappointed after 6 days of usage 
worth product
this phone is quite fast its finger sensor is useless when ever i try to use the finger sensor it says lens is dirty who will clean the sensor before every use or who will wash hands regularly before every use one more point i could not find tempered glass screen protector for this phone i tried two screens but they broke after few days of use i ordered one from amazon but that one did not fit properly on tis phone and broke within few days
nice
worked only a day then it collapsed automatically
disappointed me some basic features are skipped yellow light call recorder not working call log difficult to delete call from list makes difficult to operate smoothlymade me sad
poor
while trying to register for warranty it says no devicefound how to register for warranty

so far so good  have been a lenovo user for a while  the phone does not disappoint it is for sure value for money just one issue  i am unable to record calls on the go  please do not buy it for the camera  otherwise it will take care of your basic daily requirements for a phone
no timely updates
good product
killer note that is what this beast of a phone is
its really too good but one problem i facing that the phone doesnt support jbl headphonesand i dont know which headphones will be support 
no complaints
good
excellent performance of device
dont buy it  if you buy this product you will be in trouble with your body temperature even in winter also
battery weak
product is good but battery back up is not proper
it was mentioned as turbo charger it is taking 5 hours to charge disappointed 
nice
good budget phone compare to other in this segment 
great camera quality
in this mobile dual speaker but only one speaker working i was complain it but no action apply against this better purchase motorola mobile
good mobile in this price segmentcamera photoes quality is excellentnormal mode but depth mode require some more accuracy to focus on objectoverall a good smartphone
just a word awesome
not good
very nice
i am using this phone since last 2 weeks battery life is not as good as they are marketing if i use the games and internet it lasts only for 8  10 hours its not acceptable for new phone like lenovo otherwise all other features camera overall performance is too good look wise also its nice best phone in this price range as compared to any other brand
good
bougt this phone with great expectations but i had great disappointment there many key features missingif you are used to mi i better suggest you go for note41no call recording also third party app even pro version wont work 2call history of only 3 calls per contact3torch flash is very bad4phone heats up during charging and also after
it hangs a little bit and lags some fps in gaming like brothers in arms 3 etc the deca core consumes more battery but still it manages to have power for a day the front camera is very good but the rear one is not good honor 6x has better rear camera than this the stock android is nice and smooth but sometimes you have to restart your phone to work smoothly
best
dont buy heavy battery draining issue even when it is in idle
bluetooth connection issues pairing issues with everythinglenovo customer care openly admitting there is issue in phonenow i am stuck with it can return also this kind of software issues should be deemed as a defective product by amazon
slightly over heating issues and slight hanging issues
paisa vasool phone
average product not so good as other lenovo mobilespoor battery backup of 1415 hrs mobile heats up while running applicationsproduct not updated with current patches appx 700mb update done after receiving the productno turbo charging mentioned on pack turbo chargereither its duplicate product or inferior quality by lenovowastage of money
good
great phone
bad
nice features as i expected mobile ok
35 mm earphone jack is not proper none of the earphones is fitting properly customer care people has asked to get it checked with service centre i had checked on forum and many people have been facing similar problembattery drains fast even after a normal use
awesome phone
nice mobile
awesome battery lifeu can go for it
good phone
this phone will be good sensor touch also okbut camera is not good
this the worst mobile i ever seen in my life  i bought one year back and phone is dead within one year  my view dont ever try to buy lenovo mobiles
its awesome
back of the phone has dent whithin 1 month
not good as it describes bluetooth not getting connected
it not so use full piece is defective and cant on
why i gave only one star after one day of use just because 1 incoming calls are suspended few minutes after the screen locks  if someone calls it says out of reach  or i would have rate it 3 and half stars2 battery backup is not what i expectednot worthy for a 4000 mah3 camera quality is also below average4 performance is very nice and smooth5 sound quality is very nice and loud in speaker but lil less sound with super quality in earphones 6 looks is awesome 
this is a wonderful product
it is good budget phone and also working goodcamera of phone is awesome
this phone is not able to connect bluetooth properly it takes 4 to 5 times but audio breaks for some time and some time it connects well next thing is audio port for headphones is a complete failure it always moves and disconnects actually i thought of going to take my phone to lenovo service center where as the previous phone which i used was perfect over these aspects dual camera is of no effect dolby atmos is incredible for this reason only i bought this phone gorilla glass is no1 touch and finger print sensor is awesome 4gb ram rocks in speed
battery drains fast and slow charging
its hanging too much not happy with the product  i am feeling faked after buying this hope i could exchange it 
this is not matched with the lenovo k8 note phone not covered whole part also camera and sensor not properly adjust with this glass
ok
mobile is great using it for 5 month only problem is battery does not last longer even after the oreo update
superb phone no issue at all 24 hrs since i have used it no heating issues and good battery just one charge has lasted over 27 hrs  superfast no lag
good experience with lenovo k8 note plus duel camera with high definition

just received the phone which i bought using card payment and the phone is dead on arrival its not even switching on shame to lenovo and amazon
nice handset
i have been using this phone for a week now and it is perfectly fine the performance for normal apps is best i am not a gaming guy but the other business apps work best no lag no heating issue charges fast camera is ok sounds are awesome with normal earphones also
good bt not as expected
its gud speed processing
i have been using this product since 20th august and its been good but not in par with the contenders like redmi note 4 or the recently launched moto g5s plus but to be frank its a good phone in its way the design is a choice of preference i like it but you may not so its matter of preference and dont forget to get a case its a slippery device its a bit on heavy side but its not a big deal the display is good but i wish it could be more brighter the builtin speaker is goodits loud and crispfor the price the dolby atmos is a gimmick i dont see much improvement when turned on or off but still its there if you want but the builtin dac for the headphones is on a bit of lower side i dont see it as a good one audiophiles stay away from this coming to the cameras they are ok but there is a need of improvement the primary camera13mp is good for outdoor shots but in indoors its worse you need to go for other option if indoor is your preference flash can light up but you trade in for noise and you have a depth effect which uses the second sensor5mp at he back to add a bokeh effect and its in need for a huge improvement the edges of the subject is soft and to find the focus you will have a hard time the video quality is good if you have enough light but there is no image stabilization so you need to have steady hands and it tops out only at 1080p at 30fps while the processor can handle 4k the front facing camera13mp is good though if you are in need it has a dedicated selfie flash and it works the battery backup is also good i get nearly 45 hrs of screen on time but it depends because the mtk processor in this is not that efficient but you get rapid charging which charges the phone from 0100 in about one and half hour to two hours the software is similar to what we get in moto devicessince moto makes these devices so you can expect pure build of android with 711 nougat but i havent seen any security updates and its on july months patch the performance is good for the price you are paying i think memory management is a bit on aggressive side but its ok you cant expect much from a mid ranger i will update the review once it is update to android o
good till now
bad than 10or g
there is no screen shot optionand your service center service is poor in indore there is no gallery
facebook and some of apps are not open
not even 1 year completed now showing heating as well as battery issue it gets drained out early and after that not charging fast
best phonecamera quality is very goodvery fast speed
item was defectivedont know it will replace back also the price cut down by rs2000 feeling cheated by amazon 
an ok product for the price
over all gud  but battery work is not gudslowly charge and fast empty
im happy
good phone with in the budget works smoothly and camera is great mediatek helio x23 works fine lets see for futurecons  no nfc no ir blaster
it can beat any phone both within same range cost and beyond its cost a phone costs about 20k also cant compete with this phone no heating issue extreme speed of processing a sexy look from front side oval type glass hillarious sound with its dolby atmos speaker full water  scratch proof the best part is the back duak camera with which you can record video in slow motion mode  can take picture in depth mode and then can edit those pictures in depth mode also believe meits simply the best among all smart phone in its rang  beyond its range also
i bought lenovo k8 note one month back and lenovo make me to think why i choose lenovo it is just one month cell with lot of problem and no proper service or feedback from customer care main problem is battery issue in just 3 hours my battery goes from 100 to 60 and i try to reach customer care but no use no proper service very worst better before buying pls think twice

so cool handset

initially looks good after using two three months stars to hang abruptly though it is 4gb ram speed is very bad battery is about 4000mah still drains very fast not worth to buy this product
really good phone
i thought that camera has best feature with dual camera but when you capture with dual camera its not naturalseems to be edited
waste of money if lenovo dont know what is turbo charging ill explain it taking 3 hours to charge is that turbo charging and that will drain in hours of matter is that called battery back up please stop making people fools with false promises u can survive now by fake promise and advertising but once u lost trust you cannot be in market race
super
there are many issues in this device1 poor sound quality2 network issue if you switch from wifi to mobile data internet will not work you have to restart your device3 fluctuating network signal4 earpiece volume is very very low almost half of k4 note music quality is very bad5 you will get a lot of noises while listening music5 speaker volume is very low cant hear call sound in little crowd6 battery drains very quicklyplease dont buy it

worst phone i bought this phone last week it fell down from 1 feet corilla glass broken cheap quality my previous phones fell many time from my hand never brokenmany complaints there regarding this model touch screen broken issue i went to near by lenovo service centre there already six k8 note phones with broken displayit is failure model
awesome phonereceieved 2 days back earlier i was sceptical after reading reviews but i m satisfied after receiving it both cameras are working fine its not very heavy and bulky looks sleek and very good features
its a good phone with good specifications
after using the phone the design and display is great but many bugs are there in this new product and i found thisfirstly the power button is not working properly secondly the dolby atmos is not working properly third the battery drains out quicklyi found many more also the processor heats extensively i would request my buyers look properly before any purchase of k8 noteits worthless today is the sale dont go for this phone
better than otherssatishfied but no ear phone wd this set
after a update or watevr nw my phone battery is working properlyturbo charge works  decent battery life

as of 290817 i paid 13999 that too on line with hell lot of buying pressure now it is offered with discount of 1000 and 2000 on 3gb and 4 gb respectivelyits not even that worth you opt for xiomi or redmi but not this phone
yaar wapas le ja lo isey üò†
defective product returned it and got a replacement it was still defectivecouldnt connect to wifi 
this is the worst ever product by lenovo display doesnt work properly when i try to open any menu or folder or app phone stops working get switch off automatically heating is another serious problem vibration mode did not works from first month
charger does not works after 6 months
not bad
dont buy nothing is new
i use this product last one month and i feel good about lenovo k8 note this is very nice smartphone and good performance no heating no hanging great camera quality i really happy after buying this smartphone
to vorest product dont purchase this mobile
expected the beast performance however very disappointed with its performance cheaters i am not sure why is amazon promoting lenovo so much and making it so tempting for customer to have it
upgraded from k3 note definitely speed improvements seen little better camera too but not really a featurerich device doesnt even have some basic features that were there in k3 note  average power backup
best phone at best pricephone functioning is smooth just like makkhan at this price tag i think this phone prove to be value for moneybattery life is good goes almost a day for average calling  data usage but for heavy caller  data usage it may work max 67 hrs a day little bit heating issue faced while charging but leaving this thing apart its a best midrange value phone between 1015k
could give it 5 stars but its battery backup is very badeverything is good but the battery disappoints very badly
improve flash quality
best smartphone by lenovo
worst mobileit claims to be a 4000 mah battery but charging doesnt last even a half daydoesnt get the signals of sim networkschecked by inserting sims in another mobile sims got good signals in itheats up quicklyfront camera is 13 mp but photo clarity is like 5mp
after use of 5 months i will say poor quality product please dont buy
very poor battery backup  i think my money was wasted by buying this product
i have bought it 5 days beforethank you amazon for quick delivery phone is working fine but battery backup is not much as expected rather then phone is good in this budget
nice

have been using the lenovo vibe k8 note for the last few days and was shocked by their warranty policy when i visited their service centre in jayanagar bangalore the warranty covers only software issues only the gorilla glass is of cheap and mediocre quality as mine cracked on falling to the ground the cost of replacing the panel was rs 5500 the warranty did not cover the same was terribly disappointed with lenovo
lenovo k8 note is pathatic  very slow very fast battery heating operating system is freezing and not alert saved option get reset automatic no sms alert etc very heavy and fat as well

featured packed phone for a low price screen gives a rich feel it is splash proof many of the costlier phns too dont have this feature decent camera but bad bokeh mode the camera cant trace borders properly battery backup not upto the mark it has a 4000mah battery yet it gives a back up of 1012 hrs on moderate usage sometimes applications lag they become unresponsive as well thank you amazon for the refund on this

hai i bought a new levono k8 note the levono system is upgraded the battery charging very slow why  whats happening whats the solution
battery backup is not goodoverall performance is good
worth for your money
overall phone does well ram and rom are extraordinary battery backup and rapid charging is very good especially rear and front camera is superbbut when i connect it to any speakers via bluetooth its very irritating totally disappointed in this matter i hope that manufacturer can fix this problem in the next system update when i listen the music via bluetooth speakers it interrupts very much but lenovo k6 power works very well when compared to k8 note
perfect phone
here is a true review after 10 days of usecast screen is not workingor some good fetures like many lights indicatordata speed indicator in notification is not available like older version of lenovo notessome fetures is degrade instead of upgradefront flash light is good but no results of dual camerasbut in this price this phone is very good
overheating even during mild usage  it gets hot like hell
good phone battery is only prob
nice product loved itthe only thing which bothers is no inbuilt call recorder but we can definitely go for third party apps for that
the product recieved as it was described nice phone in this price range
overall product is good but in headset audio output is very low poor even ordinary phone of 23 k range has this much output may be it is manufacturing defect as i used lenovo k4  5 and found audio quality very good of these edition and for same reason and experience i ordered k8 note asked amazon for a replacement lets hope to get something positive in replaced handset  hope amazon will help me get a replaced one will update full review and rating only after receiving replacement 
very good phone
i got the phone yesterday evening only and i am very disappointed with the product lenovo is such a brand and coming up with this type of phone will degrade its reputation i bought this phone because i previously used k3 notefollowing are its cons1 camera is very bad i captured a couple of pics in night mode and day mode there are really very bad with regards to clarity2 they say its turbo charging but the charging is no that speedy it gets fully charged at 6hrs 30 mints please suggest me how can it be called turbo charger if its so slow3 the look is not that nice and attractive4 it gets heat very fast5 the battery also drains very fast and with in no time it comes to 506 sound quality they say its dolby but no where it is near to iti would really avoid purchasing this phone instead go for oneplus 5 or samsung j7 or c7
mbl is good but it is routed device so some apps were not running on this mbl
perfect phone in this range amazon doing great job
dont buy this product i buy this before a week ago and it is not working correctly
the mobile is not good the battery lasts only for an hour if you have charged fully and charging time is taken more as compared to other mobiles also the battery heating problem is there
amazon is very good service of delivery nice set which is very smarttill i give 4 star and i will check 56 days more it then i give final review
good phone value for money
really a good package
very poor quality all apps will be like not responding waste of buying lenovo  i am writing this review after 3 months of usage
nice
product not up to satisfaction
battery backup üëé  depth mode bakwasssssartificial lagta hai
very badit is heating too much immediately when we use internet and declining battery fast or drains
very poor experience turbo charging is not workingover heating huge battery loss
my review after 1 week use of this phoneheating problemcharging super fastback camera patriod mode not availablefront camera is goodbattery will last for 3 to 4 hours in continue gaminggetting hang when i use for 34 hours continouslyheating is main problem im facing right nowits get so much heatwe get only 22gb free internal storage out 32 gb and that is not good for me
phone is slim and it looks good and performance is also great good for gaming people and battery life is also amazingpicture quality is also good just waiting for an update so that it can record 4k video and slow mo
very poorscreen cast not workingspeaker not goodworst phoneblessing unlucky to have it
battery drain fastly
have been a lenovo fan  but this k8 note is not a great phone in terms of comfort of handlingit is very slippery and does not fit into our handsscreen replacement costs rs5500 for a phone of 14k battery life is better but not as per the claimsui is good bought this for me and redmi note 4for my wifelooks redmi note4 scores hands down
i m purchase this phonephone looking best but 1 two sim memory dont use 2you use only 15 minute phone are hot3sound quality not satisfaction overall phone r very bed phone
i feel cheated by lenovoplease dont buy this phoneit may have a good hardware but stock android provided with k8 is just intolerablelet me just jot down few of the many reasons1 no inbuilt call recording facility2 no scheduled power onoff option3 no gallery u have to use googles photo app instead4 it takes a long time to show a flashy lenovo animation which is truly a waste if time for me u need to root ur phone to change it5 the call log stores only last 3 call details for each caller6 at the back the dual camera which boasts of capturing depth of field is a crap it shoots out of focus photos more often than a sharp one and only shoots in bright light i have thoroughly clicked many snaps with that option7 no inbuilt app for selecting other themes8 battery of 4000mah doesnt perform well it hardly lasts 16hrs with a heavy use of internetwifimobile data9 the product comes with a clear tag with new system update  but till date i have neither received any softwaresystem update nor have i been notified about it and i am worried if it oreo update brings up new issues of malfunctioning as reported widely in different forumsi feel so tired of writing these cons about k8 that it will be difficult to explain its pros after thisamazon has been good as always in delivery
screen cast not working
all features are good except the screen quality i have kept it in my mobile pocket while driving when i have taken it back in my hand i have seen cracks in screen i have seen the videos saying screen is strong but it is not for replacing screen lenovo authorised service centres are mentioning different prices in different service centre one lenovo service centre quoted 8500 another lenovo service centre quoted 5800
fabüëç i like it 
produce too much heat battery performance not up to the mark picture quality average so i will suggest others not to buy this product you will get better product at this price

best phone in this price range
superb value for money
overall its quite a good phone when compared to others in its segment and certainly one cant compare this one with one plus or samsungapple high end phones but then lenovo can improve in this segment by providing ltelte support for both the sim slots otherwise if one is thinking on not investing more on a mobile phone as the technology changes rapidly this one is a good bet
mobile feature was good but depth camera must improve
received a defective speaker
worth the value for money
mobile phone and its features are awesome but it slipped from 3 ft distence and its gorilla glass 4 broken it was not delivered properly i received delivered confirmation without received i send mails spoke directly to customer care and finally got my phonerest cameras are fine featured phone i can suggest you to buy it but please get it protected firstthen use

camera click makes a big sound as if an old camera of 1950s was working there is no ear phone cord with the package and software space left out of 4 gb ram after minimal preinstalled software is too small performance is just ok rest of it is being explored still as i got the delivery on 231017 charger cable is shorter this time than it has been with lenovo previously perhaps to cut costs not a phone to be proud of in this price segmentsome negative features of amazon cannot be blamed on lenovophone heats up quickly i just checked it twice avoid it i downgraded it further from  soso to cheapsajad ahmed

cast screen is also not working and found the same complaint from several customers on lenovo portal all phones of k8 sires are def and dumb did a research and spoke with lenovo tech agent and found this is a stock android os based phone thus customer needs to make a additional hardware purchase for google cromecast dongle to make cast screen this information they should provide while selling this yellow light of camera who makes flash light with yellow light thats too for rear camera photographs amazon has lied to me for the return of this product had to reset phone same day since google service was not working even other applications were also got crashed after phone reset it is giving the same problem camera is very poor darn bad dont go for this phone with 13 mp you cannot take 169 photos and its very poor feature when comes to take in depth photograph over all bad phone single camera is better then dual camera with 135 mp cameras which cannot shoot full screen or 169 photographs if i could rate this experience to day as append with amazon rep did not even provided supervisor that woman rep was awful no quick replacement or exchange even i am prime member snap deal has given me replacement in 2 days with pickup and new item delivery same day i appreciate snap deal

paisa wasoolcamera qualityjust finebattery jaldi garam ho jati hbattery backupfineis price par processer is also good
not satisfied with rear camera its worst dual camera but front camera is good
it is a very good product i am using it regularly with other smartphones such as geoni a1 mi redme 4a lenovo k3 note and some other smartphones such as intex aqua and lenovo a 7700 i found this set very comparable and nice
in my opinion lenovo k8 note is not as good as my lenovo k6 power before i bought this phone i saw the advertisement of lenovo k8 note which shows that lenovo k8 has a very high quality of camera and also has a good quality of speakers but actually in my experience my lenovo k6 powers quality of sound is far far much better and also has a high volume boost then this handset my this purchase is somewhat very disappointing as i have paid a great deal of money thank you
it is the best  super performance an
efficient
lenovo k8 note is good looking nice finishing body camera is good but not like too goodmain issue is very hot back side in charge battery  internet use  movies watchingprice is high quality  sounds are to good
this mobile is very nice
great phone for this much price i have been using this phone widout a screen guard not a scratch on the screen i keep my phone with keys n all in my pocket as for performance dont know about gaming but yeah you can open a lot of common apps without a lag the build quality is great and tough one

lenovo k8 note is very fast mobile and 4gb ram 64gb rom and performance is very well and so many fast and camera as front camera 13mp and black camera dule camera 5mp and 13mpvenom black so beautiful looking
most important feature  camera is not goodat all camera is good on papers only not in realbattery backup is not good after 3 months and its taking 6 hours plus for full chargingperformance lags as compared to k3
experience your expectations for this price
screen cast doesnt worksrecomends chrome castand no call recording option
bad emits nd system ui is not responding very slow in clicking pics bad bad
its too good phone but 3 minus point is battery capacity 4000 mah but its not capable 4000 if u r continued used bettery used so fastly and charging is turbo so long lasting time need and second if u r enable fingerprint sensor ur battery used fastly and heat mobile in ur pocket third is in back camera is not stable bcoz autofacous not available then many photos clicked blur but camera features are good  natural photography finally its good phone by cost and features that price not available any other phones i think my way its excellent

nice phone after new update battery and camera improved
this mobile is heating problem more and not charge fast 1hr in 17 only or not battery backup
battery life discharging not more than a day or even less and other app feature like cast to tv is not working üòî
its good
i got my k8 note two days before yesterday the phone was defective there was lots of cache and seems like someone used it  because cache generation is only due to processing of the phn the screelock was not working after clearing cache it started working  the wallpaper blacked out  means interface freeze on the first day  the phn is highly unstable the software is also not working properly dont buy it and also amazons customer service agents are just giving me the excuse of proper process of returning they are just trying to get rid of the scenario
poor product
bought this phone on 25th got it delivered by 27th and after using it for a week can say that the phone features and speed is good sound is good back camera is good after ota update front camera is average battery survives through the day and charges to 100 in about one and a half hour the major issue which i faced was network issues for the incoming calls  for which have to return the phone to amazon else the phone was good  probably that defect might have been only on my handset anyways getting the refund so not much of worry 
after using the phone for 4 months i am disappointedthere is problem in bluetooth not works properly with bluetooth speakercan lenovo give update for this
bad cameras
i am using lenovo k8 note and found that this is useless phone very poor processor heat too much
phone looks good and screen is good too but the battery is poor even though it is of 4000 mah capacity it doesnt even last for 24 hours even though the brand says that there is turbo charging it actually takes 3 hours to charge fully so basically you will need to charge your phone twice in a day for 3 hours each time
good handling and best technology for motorola ltd india is the best
dont buy this product i brought it last year in december just after 3 months started having heating problems and phone turning off then eventually it stopped working went to service center they said motherboard problems but they dont have motherboard currently to change it so after waiting for quite a few days took it back and showed it at another place then also not repaired then again gave to service center they said warranty is over as its opened outside then i said i will pay for whatever repair there is they said motherboard cost 14500 thats even more than the cost of phone now so now that phone is wastage company is just nicking customers because they priced its parts so high that no one would go for repair so recommend not to go for this phone or you will regret it
fluctuating wifi receiving signals wifi gets disconnected too frequently within my home i also have motorola phone with which i donot face this wifi drop so frequently signals dropping is very irritating and frustrating while working online
screen cast not working in lenovo k 8 noteplease update this issue by lenovo

not at all recommended my lenovo k8 has the following issues1 poor signal strength  tried different sims like vodafone jio etc but signal shows only 23 bars whereas the same sims when inserted in other 4g handsets it shows full strength n no call drops2 heating problem the company has added 4000 mah battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly on using simple daytoday work it gets heated like anything and the full battery drains within half day3 slow performance even after introduced 4gb ram the handset is slow its not clear n not declared which type of 4 ram they have insertedi ordered the first day of its launch at amazon and one of the early users but my overall expectations are not met and not satisfied with the money i spent
super value for moneyal though depth mode takes time to shoot but results are good enough for a budget phone
a good hardy device nicely priced processor ok but device gets warm when used a little heavier camera good overall a nice budget phone from lenovo
nice
have been using this since 3 weeks cool to have a decacore processorno lag no performance issues i have not tested graphic intensive games yet biggest drawback for me is no direct screen cast to smart tv unlike other competitors bokeh feature of the camera is not perfect
not good one
2 weeks after getting the phone it stopped working it is switched off and does not switch on by any means
i did not get cashback
front camera quality is poor in nightsound is superbdisplay is sharp and clearback camera needs some improvement

dolby atmos is not working so i have retrun mobile
excellent product
good expense
everything is fine but camera is worst
i am writing this review after 7 months of usagein the package mobile turbo charging adapter usb cable plastic case normal screen guard sim ejector toolcamera good for photos and videos in this pricing segment for daylight images struggles when it comes to night photography slow motion video recording is defiantly not up to the markos got the system update lenovo keeps sending the software updates time to time despite keeping the software of the phone up to date the performance of the phone is not up to the mark phone  contacts both are default apps doesnt work some times takes 30 to 40 sec to load the screen any app be it facebook instagram etc handgs once in a day due to phone performance issues what is the point of having 4 gb ram heating issue when playing heavy games like asphalt 8 and the app hangs giving worst gaming experiencebattery4000 mah battery takes 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100 with the turbo charger provided if you are a heavy user battery comes for 6 to 8 hours else it might come for 12 hours at maxphone speaker not loud enough while playing music out also while in traffic you cant hear the calls absolutely not even a single word speaker sucks
really nice
expect for the ram  internal memory the function of this k8 note is far below previous k4 note which iam using presently the camera is very poor and dolby atmos function is totally useless again when compared to k4 note i expected too much and thought will be better than k4 note in all terms extra features like flip phone power off full screen photoin built dolby function present in k4 not available in k8 single speaker is totally poor when compared to twin speakers in k4
hmmm good
simply awesome device
very good
good phone but the offer of rs 343 with idea is not working idea team is telling handset lenovo k8 note is not supporting this offer
disappointed with camera camera quality is not up to the mark and it is too slow to capture photo when flash is on
all the features are awesome
bad experience
better experience of a stock android good battery backup selfie camera is good back camera is want to improve and so on
the phone has a good look with marvellous finishingthe camera quality is awesomethe battery performance is upto the level
even there is only speaker grill the sound quality is good
worst by lenovo
worst buy big mistake
this is a horrible phone its just 10 days since purchased the phone hangs often zero rating for this awful instrument
product is really awesome i like the battery backup but the screen quality is not so good and its not up to the mark but phone is really good
there were so many features are missing where when we compare to other lenovo phonebattery is not much worthy and it is been mentioned 4000 mah but the battery back up is too lowthere was lot of bugs were seen in one day usage itselffinger print is working finecamera is also good and greatdesign of the mobile phone is gooda dedicated memory card slot is very good and we can use both sim and a memory card that one of the biggest advantage in thisin overall it is not worthy for 13k mobile if more features are been added may be it can be worthy for that amount
heating problem in mobile and battery quality is so poor
satisfactory
network connectivity is poorcamera is not as expected given the hypeneed a screenshot button in the status bar and an call recording option as well
the wifi is not working after security update
ok
nice phone
i purchased lenovo k8 note on 25082017 salefirst of all thanks to amazon for quick delivery i recieved on 27 morningafter 5 days of use and testing my opinion about lenovo k8 note ispros1 dedicated sd card slot2 display and resolution approx 480ppi and corning gorilla glass protection3 no hanging issues and lag free4 stock android and google assistant and split screen mode5 cameradual camera is ok depth enabling has to improve and front cam is best in this price with flash6 finger print scanner is so fast and accurate 957 ram management even 2 games and apps open simoltaneously working fine no problem detected8 dolby atoms even single speaker it gives decent soundcons1 even it is a deca core processor performs well and heats up as well up to 40 deg2 the sound from microphone is low while recording videos3 fast charger provided but it takes nearly 2 hr of time to charge and it gives 6 to 612 hr screen on time4 battery lasts for 1 day for heavy use and 1 12 days for normal use5 the charger sounds like keeeeeeee while charging and while charging device heats upoverall it is a good phone we have to compromise on heating as it is mediatek processor it performs well and heats as wellif atleast they used snapdragon 625 the phone would be a game changeran update could fix camera and battery optimzation and heating my rating is 355
my phone is get heated from back sideso tell what should i do
excellent phone
audio problem  no multi tasking bluetooth not matching with audio
this lenovo phone is really awesome unexpected things were it has 25d curve screen and the display is quite big looks really good in reality display is clear and shinythe customized keypadit has been customized systematically not so big not so small just perfectit covers small portion of the screenwhich is really sensible thing according to me everything else is perfect
cant buy this phone because many features not run properly mobile hang problem cast screen not work basic applications not inbuilt
killer device nothing to say
battery problem
nice buyshould buy and shouldnt miss it
not refunding option this is wrost mobile
after updating to android oreo this phone really sucks pathetic battery life heating and hanging feel like throwing it on a wall
only for battery issue performance wise amazing

no handfree with handset i am a music lover so that deal was very costly for me remaining is good
because this phone is not volte support only lte
camera quality is great can click pics in hdr and also many options on focus etc
camera quality is good not super
fantastic phone with all high quality specs but phone is slightly heating but now every phone does
its a pretty decent phone the dual camera isnt that great discharge rate is faster the screen is very fragile i have dropped my mobile only once that too not on the screen facing side it broke into pieces proper screen guards are also not available due to the screen curved design
a very good phone with ample storage and fast processor my phone storage is now 50 full but it works just as fast cameras at both ends are pretty good depth in videos are well observed brightness lack of it is a minor drawback
good
i used this phone for only 11 days and suddenly battery drain and now phone is not butting on may be software corrupted completely dissatisfied with the phone
mobile has fallen down from half meter above and display brokengorilla glass is not genuine
great performance camera is excellentbut some things heating at charging time otherwise awosame i love lenovo k8 note the best product sell by amazon
üëçüëçüëç
its the jack of all trades but king of none battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor battery drains quite fast camera is better than average and i think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone kinda bums me outupdate after 3 day usebattery back up is really horrible normal usage like whatsapp and instagram browsing consumes more than 25 battery in an hour or sothen there is turbocharging issue it starts with fast charging then after 1020 minutesdepending upon mood rate decreases it took 7 hours to charge it by 40 in totalwould really appreciate if amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models i personally would not trust my 14k bucks with lenovo or moto from this point on
ooosm phone
too much heat think before buying it
nice phone
what is not in k8 note1 gallery2 battery percentage3 dolby isnt up to the mark  as compare with lenovo k4 note4 crop age option5 cant set ringtone as u want6 took 8 hours to full chargeexcept that it is best mobile of lenovo

i am very dissatisfied due to it was not call voice recorder facility and sms not sending properly finally this product is very burst
mobile is good no heating but camera is very bad worst

hiting problem  no camera qaleti
good product
nice phone with killer features
the best in its budget üòò
lenovo is better then others and its amazing
great piece of equipment brought out by amazon i liked the dual rear camera performance i recommend this product with the price tag range
if anyone is thinking about this phone then brosis you are going for a very bad phone other companies are offering very good mobiles in this rangethere are not any specifics near description no turbo charger and battery quality is also very bad drains too fast brightness issue also and phone heats unexpectedly even in ideal conditioni think amazon is selling duplicate product or this mobile is worst
awesome phone great display great features
loved it üòç
nice look worthful handy
best phone in this pricegreat picturesgreat in built qualityit came in very good boxseller is very good

amazing performance
1 serious heating issues on the back side2 headphone slot is narrow u have push headphone jack very hard by doing so you might break your jack3 not latching to the mobile network easily4 lookwise just a regular slab phone5 its heavynot expected from a brand like lenovoits not a killer phone lenovo you just killed the lenovo k8 note branding
all hype no performance truly disappointed by this phone terrible camera heavy battery issue hangs even though its stock android with 4 go ram
mobile is good camera results is super but battary backup is half day net connectivity and net speed is slowly 
not good phoneit heats very much every time
camera is not good as expected according to dual camerawith depth camera there no flash optionoverall good phonenot excellentüòôüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòéüòéüòéüòé
this is worst product cam quality is not good sound not good worst screen it is not gorella glass simply got scratches we dont talk about battery there is no words to explain about this worst battery finally dont buy this product its a toy mobile with highly expensive cost amazon battery to take these product back if no the reputation of amazon is fall down
1this phone have network problems probably secondary to sim card socket problem 2 immediately battery drain3 here written returnable in 7 days  but once it delivered u cant return to amazon or dealer
no doubt product is excellent in its price bracket
only one colour led light white bt light not working for whatsapp messages no such heating issues awesome game handling nice phone
heavy
at first i was worried whether to buy this mobile or not because the reviews were very bad but i still bought it after using this mobile for three months i realised that all those reviews were not that true i play heavy games easily on this mobile it does not hang at all any device gets a little warm while working that doesnt mean that its not working properly the battery life is also good there is no other mobile with so many features at so less price i am really happy with it
1 product received on time2 the packing of the product was not up to the mark definite scope of improvement for amazon3 product received in very good condition4 phone working in good condition with no problem of hanging any time5 satisfied with camera quality both rear and front6 slightly on heavier side in weight and does get heated up 7 over all satisfied with the product
pros1 comes with a factory fitted silicon case2 ok interface for stock android3 good looking phone4 dolby atmos is a good inclusioncons1 battery on single sim lasts 1214hrs for a power user a dual sim would further reduce longevity2 the much vaulted camera has a delayed shutter actioni used this phone after using a redmi 3s the k8 pales in comparison in terms of key user parameters
plzz dont buy this phone if you are accepting that this phone battery will long last till a day thats not possible beacuse this phone battery drains very fast inspite of being a 4000mah battery ultimately this phone is worthless i had wasted my money plzz u dont dare to do the same this phone has heating problem too iam crying for my money know this is a dumb phone
only battery draining fastly  otherwise it is an awesome smartphone at budget range
good fone lenov k8 note and extent parfomus
ear phone is missing from packetso kindly look into this

leak nd heating problem
not volte phone only lte mat layna es phone ko bakbas hay battery v nahi chalta hay
the phone battert isnt getting charged nd its getting drained early battery issue was ryt from the start
i am a music maniac i was using lenovo k5 note since one and half year and again i preferred lenovo k8 note this time only because of lenovo dolby atmos but the output of headset jack is really very very worst when compared to k5 note the volume output of k8 note is around 30 except this lenovo k8 note is fine in all ways the single star is for the performance of headphone jack
battery heat up drains faster fully charged take time 4 5 hours drains faster amazon is not taking return of this productcheaten by amazon for return

easy to access good battery life speakers volume could have been better
size is too small
depth camera very bad
cons major issue with bluetooth connectivity gets distorted all the time very very bad average camera front and back both never shows the full network range for mobilegot this phone on 12th oct but it had major bluetooth connectivity issue so placed a replacement on amazon and received the replacement unit on 24th oct which had even worse bluetooth connectivity issue than the first unit finally requested amazon for a refund wasted almost a month behind this useless devicepros  good phone build quality feels premium in hand can use dual sim along with memory cardbuy at your own risk and be ready to get a taste of amazon customer support which is very irritating and useless no coordination between departments i have already received my refund but still getting calls from amazon cc for product pickup for refund purposefinally brought mia1 which is much better device than k8 note build and camera quality is much much better than k8 note
nice
fresh as limethnx
turbo charging has stopped after 5 days it takes over 3 hours to charge the phone using the official lenovo charger battery backup is hardly 17 hours on full charge and low usage the lenovo user forum is full of complaints pertaining to battery backup of this phone the troubleshooting steps suggested by lenovo technical support have not helped at allother issues include low signal on 2nd sim  irrespective of telecom provider alarm not working when phone is switched off or on battery saverthe deca core processor is extremely powerful and the phone is blazing fast just doesnt hang or lag however despite having a 4000 mah battery the backup is appalling making the phone completely unreliable what is the point in having so much horsepower when there is no battery backup to power it no wonder the phone was being sold at a steep discountthe reviews posted on amazon are not 100 factual or accuratego through this link before you decide to buy the phone  httpsforumslenovocomt5k8xt1902smartphoneshiguysisthereanysolutionforbatterydrainissueinlenovotdp3777078

phone is good work is so fast then other phone but amazon can deliver be late 
after updating to oreo i was not able to make video call
very poor performance this time am really disappointed by lenovo
lenovo k8 is very heating phone hand and charging
superb functioning very wellgood rom  ramcamera clarity on 13 mp 5 mp is fantastic with flash and without flashkiller experience in selfie 13 mp with party flash and nicein time of online network always full  ready at any momentvery fast finger print sensor performancei like it
after 4 days of usage really very disappointed with k8 note battery backup is hell it consumes more than 45 on standby mode battery wont last for more than 3 hrs while light usage of cell phone think 10 times before you buy
finger print scanner is too poor
over all phone very good but only one problem im facing heating not only charging time any time i using phone is very hot
good performance in all departments butcamera performance is very poor
nice sturdy and good looking phone though on the heavier side phone is very responsive due to the 4gb ram and deca core processor however the battery back up is not amazing and the phone gets warm at times after using it for 3040 minutes
camera 910gaming 1010graphics 1010ram management 810performence 1010heating 910
best phone in this price segment performance is great and battery life is awesome
its very very heating issue and battery backup is very very bad 2  4 hours only if data will be used simply waste of money i did not satisfied 
for the price it matches the top brandsvery good battery life pictures taken are stunning ota upgraded to oreo works flawlessapps run smoothlywould have given 5 starthe only issue is the double tap to open is little unresponsive
please do not go for this mobile i bought from amazon in 3 months phone started showing issue with mic  and screen started showing yellow patches  went to services center of lenovo with issue you cant believe there are more than 10 cases of lenovo k8 for repair that day most of people concerned about all major issue are in warrantywhat happen after warranty back to my issue these service centreguys claims screen is not under warranty and you need to 55k to get repair of screen based on same your warranty will be re instead and then these guys will solve mic issue in warranty for same discuss i lost 2 days and these services are pathetically hopelesshope this will help please dont go for lenovo phones not worth it
nice phone
best mobile in this price range all features are good  the glass of the mobile is superb unbreakable price worth it dont hestitate while buying‚úåÔ∏è

worse product

i was expecting more than k4note but many features are missing like voice recording screen shot screen off when phone face down contracts in phone memory alphabet at side of contact list disappointed with my purchase
good camera quality good sound although it doesnt have a gallery photos directly stored in google photos
have good feature but sometimes it makes some problem
loved this device fast charging good processor speed dolby sound is awesome screen clarity is fabulouslooking into the specifications somewhere camera quality is compromised no headphone with set is really a pain
good
it‚Äôs okay
overall the phone is good but there is a issue with the volte on jio as if the phone is kept idle for 10mins then you ll keep on missing calls as the other party ll get that your sim is either switched off or not reachable this is a big flaw if the phone is volte enabled as one cant continuosly keep on using the phone just to receive a calla software update is required in this regards
just purchased the product and feature and working good batary back up comes only one day if you are not browsing much otherwise everything else looks good primary camera resolution not so high but its ok
this product is not good because many problems in this1st of calling problem 2nd of internet problem 3rd of music sound problem4th of 4g net connectivity start than call not nowso my suggestion is this product not purchased
good product
very bad experience
cost is higher than expected nobody should buy a item at the launching time
issues faced from the day of purchase itself1 flickering of brightness light2 dead pixel white on screen3 no inbuild gallery4 heating while running application5 even the battery is 4100 mah drains out quite quickly not as expected6 while running application phone sometimes hangs7 a very bad experience while receiving the phone that is no delivery late delivery and defective product received by this particular seller8 as features mentioned on social media about the phone are very good but according to my experience its not up to the mark so guys think twice before you make a purchase and make sure read all reviews from other customers too its just my personal opinion
amazing phone with great ramcamera quality also good
not good as i was expecting front camera is a bit blurry only the sound quality is gud
product is good but sound clarity is very lownot able to here sound while calling to someone
worst phone hanging at an starting stage dont buy lenovo company itself

phone features are good but facing few problems like  heating battery gets exhausted vfast and major problem is phone gets blink often
never buy this mobile serious heating problem
nice product feature rich pretty fast because of decacore processor camera quality is acceptable but not as good as mi phones build is good volte op is fine bundled back cover is slippery

battery backup is not good turbo charger doesnt work sometime and 2 time replaced then too same prblm

worst phone dont buy amazon is totally 3rd class
awesome mobile
battery back up is wrostall other fesilite is wpr
not good as expected heating too much and i faced charging issue after software update might be conflict between hardware and updates which clearly shows incompatible hardware you get only 1 day battery backup and you have to keep battery saver mode on if youre not using else it drains super fast being lenovo k4 note owner i had much expectations with k8 note though it didnt meet any of my expectation
the picture depth  clarity of the photos is average
very poor phonenever to buy this productbattery is not working properly at alldrains 2 to 3 times in a day

not a satisfactory headset problem faced are as below1 hanging problem2 very slow processing3 low battery backup up 7 hrs only4 much time taken for battery charge up to 06 hrs from 10 to 100 
basic phone and basic software
very good phone
phone is good except that battery drains a little fast and has heating issue at the top on back sidenot like boiling but you can feel the heat in 15 mins of gameplay or when using internet camera is decent comes with a transparent case which is not that good and a fast charger
worst mobile there was used mobile also
awesome phone
after use 2wk i feel following drawbackphone has network issuepoor camera  battery drain quicklyno fast charging effect wifi hot spot not work properly
very slowmsg  call basic application is not working properlyinstead use nokia
i want douplicate bill how i get it
battery back up is not as per mark  phone also hangs while calling  it also deletes contacts from phone book when put on charging and automatically opens other functions  camera quality is not excellent
yet to evaluate but i find headset missing 
waste of money worst product was using lenovo k4 note for 3 years high expectations with this model but this phone sucks 
charger is making hisss noise although it is not getting hot
very poor battery m too much unhappyit takes more dan 8hrs to charge from 5 to 100and ones u use da internet da charge becomes 0 in just 4 hrs its like always connecting ur phone to charger more than using itand also da heating trouble
its the best phone in this price range
performance design battery and turbo charging is ok but camera quality and display clarity is not as per expectation
not give at list 1 stari m using handset from last 6 month and there is bigger and bigger heating prob valueless mobile phone
cancelled order before delivery the reviews are very bad for oreo update the phone becomes unusable and mother board is also affected by the update frequent restarts is the most common problem faced by users
good phone
lenovo k8 note has severe issues like 1 the inbound and outbound voice calls are not working while the phone is kept idle for 1 hr or more 2 jio video call is not working 3 the mobile hangs when the camera options are changed 4 the carrier signals showing weak though the other phones like lenovo k5 note shows good strength 5 call recording option is not available 6 call management for blacklist is not easy 7 the mobile is becoming warm while charging 8 sometimes the mobile hangs  it requires restart
superb
very good and useful mobile
i received lenovo k8 note on 28082017 it is getting very hot while charging it takes 3 to 4 hours to get charged with turbo charger battery gets drained very soon and do not stay even for one day return item menu also not working
both rear and front camera too poori preferred it over redmi note4 just for its camera specs but picture quality is way below for a 135mp dual can images gets blur even at slight zoom in
really a good phonegood battery lifegood processorgood cameraeverything is goodwants to improve in camera side
not as expected
the phone boasts a lot but is a let down i took it with a lot of expectations cuz this phone basically combines the best of both worlds the redmi note 4 and moto g5s plus and more its a jack of all trades and a master of none except maybe music  the battery drains during standby and moderate gaming for like ten minutes causes it to heat upit has dolby atmos sound enhancement and a dedicated music key which is a unique feature people who like music might appreciate it the fact that the sim slot is not hybrid is another plus point
not so good as expectedbattery backup is poor not worth to buy 13999 rsits a not a true smart phoneits poor in functionsthere r so many cons with this phonedont buy plscan amazon or seller ll buy backi dont want this phone
fabulous smartphone ever
mobile battery damage  mobile battery dry condition mobile refud the mobile

very good mobile
battery was drained very quicklywithin 10 minutes it 4 was drained and verified by the amazon technician
nice product from lenovoeverythings good shall share the bads  heating issue is there with phone gets slow on extensive usage doesnt feel like working on 4gb ram machine good for soft use
jio sim working with very poor signal both data  voice quality is worst  i think this is not a 4g cellphone and it is any how converted from other phones purchasing is wastage of money i purchased this phone in dec 2017
missing the dual apps feature which is a must
very good mobile set even low cost not comparable any other mobile with this cost
everything is more than average it is a all rounder phone but music output is too artificial the natural sound is totally absent there is a trend going on nowadays and even people are liking these artificial sound outputsdolby atmos
nice‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
good budget stock android phonestrong battery  turbo charging is very good feature cool camera experience dolby sound is amazing i am happy with this
sent bill
nice
very good
everything is good except all contacts are getting saved on web accounts only theres no option to save new contacts to phone memory battery back up is excellent shall provide updates on software including such added basic features
its music is not good as lenovo vibe k5only one issue
received two piece of soap inside the mobile boxshameful rating is compulsory
i like the display and working of lenovo k8 note but to my surprise started receiving problem from day onecons wifi problem repeatedly disconnects and connects againsignal fluctuation in both sim using internet is a bit time problemat times body heats which makes using mobile impossibleif you buy through amazon it will be a much more tougher task to get the mobile replaced or refund no proper responce after multiple complaintsno headset in boxprosgood sounddisplay is much better than other phones in this price rangebattery backup is goodbody finishing is betteroverall good phone if there is no network issue i strongly suggest not to buy it through amazon or anyother marketplace visit physical store so that you can check the phone at the time of buying
very bad received used product
its good but not able to make call recording
very nice product but my invoice is not coming in mail
very much satisfy with ke novo k8 note no problem at all all good about display battery looks etc
dont know why i bought this smartphone i always stick with the sd processor but the way lenovo was branding it got me attractedsold just after 4 day use battery draining was like insane 34 hours of standby also recharge problemand one thing it heat like an iron by god it was a fault to buy never ever ill be buying any mediatek processor smartphoneworstpurchaseever
awesome phone with long battery life and good camera quality turbo charger really charges fast and as im a moderate phone user my phones battery lasts almost whole day i charge it only once a day and sometimes even after 24 hrs
pros  cons explained                   1 very good sleek design and elegant look just alike iphone 7 plus2 very fast storage is abundant with sd card support is a plus3 sim and sd card slots are seperate4 very smooth to touch and android nougat rockscons1 battery runs up drained too fast when connected via 4g lte or wifi2 volume is very low than you can really imagine when played via earplugs  wired headsets  bluetooth headset or speakers3 no inbuilt gallery app or a music player so poweramp supports well when purchased at 1rest all are great including the delivery which is very fast

lenovo k8 note is a very bad product from lenovo because videos are not playing and mp3 are not playing and ringtones are not setting upif i know that im not buying this lenovo k8 noteits very bad bad bad wrost producti loss my money
never buy this product signal quality is poor cast option does not work bluetooth connectivity is poor sound breaks inbetween does not have option to edit pictures video streaming is poor or takes times to start video there dialing page is not user friendly frequent dialed number are displayed in large size hence leading to unnecessary calling on frequent dialed camera quality is very poor and pixels break on initial zoom only moreover flash light nothing worst then that overall a bad choice in same price you can find much better device meeting your expectations
bauth hi bekar phone
this is one of the worsed mobile phones i have ever used in my life  it is getting so hot while talking 
best mobile but battery not good
i fell for the spectacular specs of k4 note when it was launched it died out on me just after finishing the warranty periodhorrible support team and ridiculously expensive repair so i ditched it loosing some data also along with itand then i did it again i fell for fake glitters when the k8 note was launched despite all the friendly warnings hardly a month in its already starting to taste bitter‚Ä¶casting doesnt workrestarts all too often at its own willa dual camera that is a jokemany apps hangs often despite the jaw dropping specs deca core my footverdict lenovo is not dependable
very good deal  value for money working smooth even in 3gb ram only reason for not giving 5 star bcoz it is not coming with earphone
not supported to volte  camera is not good and voice call clarity low
prosbest design 25d curved glass like nokia 6cameras are excellent except in dual modeno lagmain thing is the dolby atmosbest surround effect and if you are music lover then go for itconsbad battery backupits 3000mahnot overheating but while charging get heated up
cerema quality is so poor
superb phone worth for buying everything good packing to bad no safety for transit
camera resolution is not as per expectedit blurr too muchalso turbo charger sucksit takes 210 min to complete charge batterytoo slow
its performance is very badbattery took 4 to 5 hours time to full charge and discharge took same timecamera is ok but no special options available for editing like as sony for this product cost is too high not reasonable 8k is suffiecient no earphones packed hence my suggestion is dont purchase this phone
excellent performance
using it for 1 month now feeling like a mistakevery bad experienceheating even when idlecharger stop workingautomatically discharge from 60 to 0 overnightno phone supportworst service centereven hard to find
very bad burning like a heatervery very bad koi mat fasna
the phone came with lots of bugs the dolby atoms sound system of the phone did not work properly and need to restart the phone again and again moreover i didn‚Äôt get any refund from amazon and needed to sell it by myself
hang problem
its d the worst phone i have used ever
not as good as i was expecting
worst phone ever by lenovoheating issu ram management issue worst dual camera
very good one with nice features within an acceptable pricevery good one
all are excellent at this price range but want to improve battery life compare other 4000mah smartphones
just loved it
mobile is good but it is not connect with computer during hotspot
do not buy this model i bought it on 16 oct  it had a problem of slow charging though its supposed to be turbo charging they replaced my phone i have used this replacement phone for last 25 days now it has display problems lines appear on the display not sure how this problem will be addressed
fantastic phone in every aspect gets charged very quickly amazing sound quality for high quality movies it has dolby atmos sound if you enable dolby and watch movies with dolby sound you will get real theatric effect on this little phone with headphones on real value for money i am really surprised by the sound quality
its an excellent piece of art based on performance and battery but 15w turbo charger is not the right name for its charger because it takes around 150mins to nearly 3 hours sometimes to charge the mobile
after updating heating phone
the screen is so fragile  despite the corning gorilla glass claim  the screen broke after a small fall  i have used phones that didnt have corning gorilla glass that sustained bigger falls the price tag really explains a lot  cheap quality stuff with high specs  buy at your own risk
very bad
no fast charging took 2 hours to charge from 50100
i am shocked seeing this phone specifications and price camera quality very killer phone overall performance is killer friends buy this smartphone
not a good phone
a huge problem in all lenovo k8 note phone both speakers are not working properlyplease give me suggestion what can i do 
my phone got hanged when i switch it onit remains stucked for almost 15 minutes
fantastic phone really killer featuresvery nice camera
do not buy this phone its better to buy mi or a local chinese phone rather than buying lenovo this product overheats so much that you will not be able to hold it if you continue talking to someone via call for over 30 minutes the device will get so hot that it can burst in any point of time its been only 6 months now that i am using this and i am facing such problems even when the charger is connected the battery continues to discharge have got it checked from the service center but the issue is still not resolved

ultimate mobile  good camera  good battery backup
hellothe phone starts resetting itself randomly this issue starts after after 3 days of use especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is preinstalledi am feeling like a stupid for having done this  after that for 4 or 5 days it didnt show this issue now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night use the phone in night then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning boom it is dead already and when you manually poweron there is enough juice left in the battery not sure what to do with this kind of issue the phone is absolutely uselesswhen i approached amazon for return they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified not sure even it is rectifiable issue the below amazons tagline tagline sounds funny earths most customercentric company i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage
so bad experience this product

received faulty product phone is not turning on very baddont buy from this seller
heating like an iron box
lenovo k8 note does not support screen cast has only one colour of led notification lightno scheduled on  off optionalarm clock does not ring when phone is switched offno call record optiondaily data used cannot be seenall these features are present on much less priced redmi phonesvery much disappointedwill never recommend others to buy
nice performance 4g ram super fast
i brought this mob after using coolpad cool glass broken i expexted a lot on chnaging to a bigger brand name of lenovo but the phone is not performed as expectedi liked to compare cool pad cool with k8 noteprosbetter look nice to holdcomparing to coolpad cool thats allconsno direct wifi casting to tv you need chrome cast to cast or screen sharing this was totally disappointingbluetooth connection in car is not so smooth but the connection from coolpad cool was just superbdepth sensor of rear camera is not that good comparong to coolpad cooli am writing this because if someone said this previously i will never buy this phoneupdate after using 2 monthsbluetooth connection has some serious problemnot customizable like coolpadcamera is below averagecannot use finger print sensor selfie clicksi dont recommend this phone

good product value for money nice interface smooth working
worst phone ever worst cameratried amazon help customer care help from lenovo nothing workedbokeh mode not working at allcamera z patheticmybworst buy from amazon
phone is very heating and camera is ok not a good phone its average
phone looks ok works fine but supplied cable doesnt work and amazon as usual is unable to refund or replace it expect such problems with chinese product as amazon does not verify itdont buy
nice touch response rare camera is awsm but front camera is dull even not better than redmi note 4 sound quality is also not enough to satisfaction  redmi note 4 has thousand time better sound quality overall i dont recommend on this price range
worst phone ever seen i would suggest everyone dont ever purchase any lenovo phones u may get attracted by its price and features but they are just for name sake and not worth at all it has various issues but the top ones being extreme heating and battery draining its been just 6 months i have purchased this phone and now its fingerprint sensor is also not working as good as it was initially network connectivity issue extreme heating battery draining especially after its recent software update to oreo a complete waste of money
very less brightness no light on below key touch and no ear phones with product so then wat purpose for dolby atmos paying 13999 not much worth no otg 
so fast device superb phne
i have received the product within daysbut phone is not upto the mark battery very poor only one day staying the charging 4000mah camera also no so good there is no option of call recording call logs also not removable  delete u must be delete all call logs not singleover all its bad experiance
superb features and hd display internet experienced me a lot and enjoyable no lagging of phone
good
sound is very low either it is calling speaker video  mp3 got frustrated and camera quality is also not good as per the provide 13 mp

broi suggest you to buy it because it is nice in working but it self it is heating up only my phone heated not all lenovo k8 phones it may be product errorwaste product my gorilla glass protection broke within 20 days stupid product lenovo company not responsible for warranty
it didnt have an option to change ringtone optionit doesnt have voice recordinggoogle assistant not responding when it lock
phone is good review after one month usecamera quality is good double camera also working but its compromised but overall camera qualityscreen quality is good but brightness is very poor its very dispointing but full hd screen good onebattery life good it can survive full day if you r not using gaming or camera like heavy work for long timeprocessing is pretty fast theirs not overall hanging problem but when you start installing heavy apps then some time apps giving errors and fon is little hanging but running smoothlywater resistant is plus point its splash proof so some water doesnt effectphone is useable if you think you can buy it worth money
good mobile but screen is not scratch resistant on the day when my phone arrived at noon then after 23 hrs i found scratches on my screen but overall it is a good mobile
this lenovo k8 is no gorilaglass the amazon is chitting not my mobile glass was broken so amazon is very very very bad  friends

nice phone in this price i have gone through certain reviews on amazon smooth operating and awesome to operate if u r expecting quality of iphone in this price that will not happen but by considering cost benefit ratio its worth of its identical little issue of heating for continuous operation but u are not operating it as 24√ó7
good product and good battery life
its an ok ok phone in this price range build quality of phone is good with a metallic back battery of the phone is not dat long lasting dat is expected with a 4 k mah onethe frint camera and flash is very nice but when u will come to back camera which is the main high light of the phone  then u will be disappointed as ghe depth doesnot workfingerprint is fast and goodphone also heat up sometimesabruptly and usually during charging although during running instagra some times the phone lags othe than its decent in gaming  i will suggest mia1 rather than this rest it depends upon u  the phone also consumes data more that that of mi

all round good productbut at this price you will get better phonesdual camera is not so great software modifications needed to take advantage of dual camerasbuy mi a1 or lenovo p2 with few extrac bucks instead of this  i would recommend to skip this phone and wait for new phones or go with a little higher 1k to 2k phones as there are many features missing in this ex quick ball is missing  one hand mode is missing let me know if anyone wants to know any more information regarding the phone 
my mobile camera is giving blur photo i have done many setting feeling so bad 
its such great mobile to use
no update availlablecamera quality is poorbattery backup is also not up to markcomparing with other phones with same bugetthis is the most worst productüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé

very bad experience with lenovo battery is very bad charging from 0 to 100 takes almost upto 7 hours perhaps it has turbo charging enabled and battery draining so quickly losses 20 charge in 45 hours ie standby battery timing is not upto mark very bad experience phone is also lagging even it has been only 2 weeks of using want help from amazon plzz support
bad dual camera no backlight on home  back keys heating issues battery drains fast  not enough as per specifications totally dissappointed
not working as i thoughtnot happy with the performance of the set
battery is pathetic its drain so fast while using mobile data rear dual camera is very bad if ur using a single camera its good but the dual camera and bokeh effect is very very bad while connecting to bluetooth speaker i hear broken sound i dont whats going wrong while connecting to bluetooth speaker previous device i used was redmi note 4 has got a awesome battery backup and its ui was great
dont go for this mobile gorilla glass is very weak and waste of money for buying this mobile

i am not update phone because of in reviews so many worte heat when update the phone in is not dual standby 4g
working ok
not as expected
lenovo k8 once again tries to bring multi features under affordable limit worst try just used the phone for few days and the handset started displaying its faults it takes minimum 45 hours to charge the phone the handset gets heated up as much that you can warm your coffee cup within 3 days off purchase the handset started displaying software update alert the camera is good but consumes battery as if the handset gets hungry while photography not recommended until lenovo fix the defects am sure lenovo would soon pull out the phone from marketbuy the phone at your own risk
good but not as per description you cant use 4g sim on both slots only sim 1 is 4g
cast setting of the phone is not working
very baad battery backup and it takes long time to chahe 100
faltu maal de dia
just love the k8 note big fan of lenovo started work a7000 then k3note  k8 note is way better then redmi note 4 or honor 7x my friend has both he was in awe of my k8 note camera and network speed

nice
the mobile is nice and faster with deca core processor but some of the features are missedthere is no wide touch no colour changing for notification light and it takes 2 hours charging with turbo charging
third class product dont buy it as amazon itself not able to resolve the problem
camera is awesome great performance enough memory and storage space
i wanted to use for few days and then write a feedback its been 9 days while writing this feedback my experience with amazon support and the phone is not satisfactory at all the moment i got the phone i did all the transfer of credentials after a day i started facing this unique issue regarding loss of my data internet it would show the 4g icone with full network strength but there was a cross sign on that network strength tower i realised very soon that i cannot access to internet as long as that cross sign is there i had to restart the device or wait for few hours to get the things right this used to happen atleast 4 to 5 times in a dayso i reported this issue to amazon via app there was an option to select the return item option but apparently that link will ask you to talk to amazon tech support or install some software for checking your phoneamazon tech support sent a technician and all that he did was factory reset after doing this the phones data internet was working fine so accordingly he mentioned in his service report and handed over the copy to mebut immediately after he left i started having the same issue i reported to amazon again this time amazon customer care team tells me that technician did not find any fault hence you have to submot more proofsi did that as well but there is no solution to this i check some forum online and came to know that this is a known issue with this device had i known before buying i would not have bought it at all
i received phone with sim card tray damage average phone not a good deal
garbage phone friends dont buy it and the way its price decreased prove it go buy any other phone of mi or samsung dont waste your money may be next time its price come down to rs 1 lol
nice device for high use battery is awesome overall super performancebut i got my device with a dunt on rear casing so for that 4 stars

so many issues from day 1 had listed below before buying this product check youtube video done by geekyranjit1 recent button automatically enables frequently and there is no replacement for this phone  serious hardware issue2 led  led notifications only blinks for unread messages and doesnt blinks for missed calls whatsapp mails etc3 unlock the phone  when unlocked menu button is not working and need to lock and unlock again to get into menu4 dual cam  what is the purpose of this need explanation as what it does will be done an android app with better results5 juice  draines really fast i have another version of lenovo it comes for more than 15 days but this one does not hold for an entire day6 turbo charging  it only displays turbo charger connected and it is not charging fastly7 dolby atmos  why and what is the purpose of this application only to see dolby atmos demo video  there is no differentiation to identify  when you switch off  on it says  shows dolby atoms cant you take care of the spelling8 no headphones provided  you provide dolby atmos and you will not provide head phones for this price
i dint receive product invoice i need my warranty for my lenovo k8 note
its good but always when i make a call and raise the mobile its volume decrease by itself automatically help me out
so far so good
nice phone but inbuilt call record facility not available and key feature button light up option not available that is not that satisfactory
dont buy lenovo brand  because every second piece screen probe occurring and its life only 1 yearif you dont believe please lenovo service center then buy and single scrach avoid you warranty so first think and buy lenovo brand
looks very ordinary and feel plastic body
product is superb  bt if u want dslr like camera u will not be satisfied depth sensing is not up to the mark otherwise battery backup  deca core processor  front camera with party flash  charging time nearly 2 hrs gives a very smoother experience 
nice

most of the time dolby atmos goes off automatically and can start only after restarting the phone
i cant give a single star to this phone because this is the most worst mobile there is no picture quality no battery backup bluetooth problemheating problem
very nice

very good product
good mobiles for digital use ram is good so speedly i am working all work in online is good
heating and also quick draining spoils the performance battery at its worst
battery is draining very fastly price is too high compared to other brand on same specifications
i recommend this best phone everat this price
battery backup not good
bluetooth connectivity very bad
awsome kishor has been satisfied wth this hand set
camera disappointed me alot depth effect doesnt work as expected
nice performancesuper fast performance
its not a pure stock android and battery is not being optimised with its hardware processor is not working with its full potential
most disguesting phone everrrrrrrrrnever ever buy it battery drains like hell and very slow charging within 10 days of usagehate it totally very very bad mobile
awesome phonevery nice camera sound quality is amazingi love it
the product has nothing as what is mentioned in information provided by seller or manufacture camera is a super fail where as dolby is just ordinary doesnt work fast even with dexacore processor antenna function doesnt fully support 4g service with any service provider battery automatically drains even in standby mode live wallpaper support are not up to the mark images clicked with both front and back camera are blurred camera flash is poor for creating a budget phone lenovo has forgot basics of phone software in my opinion phone is complete failure a worst experience of my life
phone is ok got at right price hope they will provide good service that is more important
amazing the inbuilt is so nice and made by motorola this phone is combination of moto and lenovo better than any phones of mi because their phones are not trustable
after 121012 update i must say the battery life has improved very much thumbs up and the rapid charges up to 95 in two hours and 100 in 215 hrs you can use it 15 days normal or 1 day heavy usage respectively smooth running phone but there is diflections in jio network but without slowing the internet speed hope in the next update this will be corrected  good cameras  front flash  one step ahead of redmi note 4
brought this mobile in nov 2017 2 month all working fine then started network issue even near to vodafone tower its shows no network tried to switch on  off activity but no result suggest not to buy this
phone review not good every where
best performance phone for this type of budget

worst phone of lenevo
price is unbelievable few days back purchased in 13999 and today 11999 you may understand how it feels after paying extra for same product from same selleri used a6000 and compare to it this has many important feature missing1 do not have call recording feature can you believe2 no audio profiles a6000 had great way of setting audio profile while in office or outside3 blue tooth do not switch automatically when connected to car you can hear ringling when connected blue tooth but only when someone answers call very inconvenient compare to a60004 battery life is not great5 slide heating while working for long time or charginggood think is speed because of 4gb ramhd screen is greatoverall expensive compare to feature wait for some more time to get in lower price

dont buy this phone go for redmi or other brands  it doesnt performs like 4gb ram and a deca core processor  lags most of the time after android 80 update and the main advantage is u can boil rice using lenovo k8 noteinstructions  play a video  wait for 30 seconds  keep the rice cooker above k8 note  rice will b ready in 10 minextra advantage  for survival purpose u can throw at someone to break their heads  cause it weighs 10 kg sound effects r worst in its class  selfie camera its like iphone 3gsoverheating issues  battery s not charging 20 percent even if i turn of the phone never charge  battery drains quickly im having only stock android apps along with whatsapp was good only for 2 months people please don get cheated by this phones specs it doesnt perform like one  im using redmi 5 2gb varianti would honestly say redmi is way more better than lenovothis will be my last product from lenovo 
super mobile picture
very nice
it is hanging and not working properly
3rd class product mobile have issues
i am not purchase any lenovo mobile 3 gb ram phone every time hang
earphone not received with phone
wonderful phone for the price  being used by my kid and can withstand rough handling and numerous uploads  dowanloads  no issue of hanging even while playing games
been using this phone for one week good phone battery backup is excellent battery stand by is very good overheat problem is gone after few updates also got the android oreo update about the camera low light photo is not that bad what camera do you expect in this prize range in daylight the camera is very good about the speaker the clarity is very good sometimes i do some street photography i simultaneously use photoshop express adobe lightroom and snapseed i switch between this three apps i havent notice any lag overall it is good phone
writing review after using for 2 months mobiles hangs a lot heat issues please prefer to buy some good mobile instead of this k8
this one is osm
wish there was an option for zero starthe new android update to oreo is not supported by the phone which is causing the phone to charge really slow after the updateideally a turbocharger charges in less than an hour but this one takes more than 2 and lenovo technical support is also full of lame and dumb people who will tell you that the charging should take 1 hour and 40 minutes that is what a normal fast charger does and not a turbochargerbuy any other phone that already has an oreo update
best phone in this price rangedecacore processor makes it fastest great battery backup good camera good internal memory 64 gb and good 4 gb ram
battery life was not good performance waste mobile iam using last 20daysüòàüòàüòàüòàmy suggestion is dont purchase this product ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

best mobile
i purchase this phone on 31122017 this product is many problem like bluetooth is not work properly any cast screen is not supported except chromcast you cant mirroring on your tv the network issue is also found the phone is many times out of range
bad camera
nice phone camera is good but flash light is disaster it will damage your eyes soonbox packing from amazon was worst
i didnt get earphone and there is only one piece charger
not good as previous versions
the mobile phone i received has fine screen quality and average camerathe problem i am facing is the left speaker at the bottom stopped working right after two days of its delivery and i can only hear the sound from one speakeri brought lenovo k4 note last year and its a great product but i cant say the same about the lenovo k8 note handset i receivedi didnt expect this from amazon or lenovo
would have preferred the lenovo features of recording dual apps support etc very poor battery performance considering it is a 4000 mah  doesnt last beyond 18 hours price dropped just after i purchased it
expectations was high when i purchased but it failed to obtain its respect i used for only ten days and i observed that mobile getting heat at charging and on use of internet it started hang after 4 days call is not connected immediately it take timeonce it was stuck for an hour i could not able to turn off or to continue hopefully it is a disaster for me
lenovo is manufacturing good quality products but need to develop in camera section need to add motion gestures  for switching of flashlight opening of camera  where moto g5 plus is having this features
got all the important features at this price range dual camera set up is not like redmi but its ok
waste product from lenovo
very good mobile
good
good phone at this pricespecifications are good as compared to the competitorsbig battery lasts 89 hours when used continuously on high brightness but heats a lot

overall phone is ok but it has heating problem dual camera is not up to the mark of starting even no depth images captured as it was mentioned little lags in games sometime it has a deca core processor but still it lags with snapdragon 625 processor increasing cores will not result a better performance no signal stability for volte the price which they took is not worth device i gottoo much costly phone but does not have and support basic features with apps even no call recording feature even with playstore app it only record one side speaking person who have the phone but not of other side does not support to use custom tones as ring tones no stable 4g volte network battery performance degrade very soon as compare to other smart range phones even having a 4000 mah battery very disappointing product i purchase lenovo k4 note is far better than this one dumb product
good
ok good
its often hanged in any situation like online or offline i just bored with it
dont buy drains battery super fast worst battery backup  being 4000 mah battery if u want gud battery backup dont buy this camera in depth mode is useless
please dont buy this phone full of crap invest your money wisely in another brand signal problem heavy battery drain gets hot easily  ultimately useless wouldnt give even one star but as it wont accept i am forced to give 1 star got this as birthday present and surely its a flop phone
nice phone good performance

not good
battery camera not very impressive
dont buy this phone i m feeling regret by buying this phone phones has many problems applications stops every time we open it phone has touch issues also camera is the drawback of this phone coupled with laggiest proccesor
phone is good but betty is not good
i m fan of lenovo product
not good as lenovo k6 power
its not upto the expectations1 camera average2 battery back up is ok3 processor speed ok4 its get heated even for simple simple works5 look and feel okmy suggestion is donot go for this phone very unhappy with it and wants to return this item at any cost
very very worst productwhen it reached i felt happy and i opened and put the sim after that it started hanging as well as sound also not smooth
bad phone overheats dual camera is useless also randomly stopped working lenovo has outdated service center information online the service center they listed online is closed off very bad experience i guess thats what i get for buying a cheap phone
very poor performancesoftwares are working irrelevantly
guys dont buy lenovo products its a all problem mobile waste camera waste display quality dolby atmos is not working properly first watch this mobile any one hand than decide dont believe you tube videos or any mobile side its not returnable amazon and lenovo is not return the product be save dont buy mobile on online go offline stores look watch on your hand than buy
great phone for the price
it was an awesome phone which i supposed to have like it atlast i got dream phone which is having all features in it n it is different from all other phones

great and good performancelook like a cool and good
if you want a portable heater which restarts on its own and take potato quality photos then go for it
very very worst product  one speaker is not working  charging adapter is not working if charging 20 when plugged in hole day is 20battery backup is not gooddont buy this product
all hoopla and no performance lot of software programming glitches and very unuser friendly especially if you ve only used iphone and samsung back button on the left  35 mm jack ob the tip and default opening of favourites all the time in call logs to just name a few vowed never to use lenovo again will take ages to come to samsung quality leave aside i phone disappointing purchase
nice product but the hard cover with this product not good broken 2nd time dropping down also 2nd camera is dummy
this is one of the best phones one could ever get in this price range the build quality is nice and all the features are great as expected the services provided by amazon are excellent and the team is very cooperative
my last mobile was lenovo k4 compare to k4 iam not fully satisfied  mainly the software sidelot of features missingno galleryno nfc cant make our own ringtone  battery drains fastwith out battery power wat to do with other featurescamera side its oklooks goodwaiting for the updation
i bought this phone and regret my decision i bought this over redmi note 4 just because of camera but the dual camera sucks it gives very artificial bokeh effect and there is no option to turn off vibration for notifications as of now i hope lenovo will provide an update for camera and some bug fixes but lenovo is notorious for not providing updates even for phone priced higher than this devices
very nice phone
i bought on 1432018 at present no issues with handset as i got many updatesso dont worry about reviews which shown in youtubethose are old ones at the time of releaseat present it is a good choice

one of the worst phones i have ever used  within 7 months the motherboard and screen have stopped working and the service centre has not covered the product under warranty and during the usage of 7 months the performance was much below normal
good camera but 135 has no effect doing otherwise worth it courier service is very bad
very best smartphone its processor is very good its support screen cast
your customer service center advice for technical assistant help but technical service assistant do not solve lenovo k8 note venom black 4gb battery not charging by turbo charger kindly refund money or replace faulty lenovo k8 note venom black 4gb regarsthankssantosh rbt
lenovo k8 note camera is good and battery performance is to good
awesome phone with good camera
applications force stop chrome and youtube force stop again and again one of the speaker does not work battery drains fast poor dual rear camara doesnt capture adequate quality images for depth mode phone gets heated while charging display is glitching very small pixel lines showing and disappearing while charging phone sometimes

bad qualities
good product
lovable featurescamera sound picture display qualities are very niceproblemsbut it has heating problem when net connection is on4000 mah battery in this phone does not long last even for a single day56 hrs only
worst pic in low light depth mode is like a joke
speaker not working defective model  amazon representatives dont even care
overall features of phone are goodcamera is soo good music player is okbut the worest thing is battery üîãphone is like a battery line up of 2500mah
very poor response of this mobile battery no run more then 8 hour and over heating problem occurs any time
good
himobile look is goodbut not bad productcharging complaintmobile very heatcamera clearty lowheadset not received
price dropped ‚Çπ2000 after 5 days when i boughtok phone theres heating issues you get a cheap plastic case with it camera is also not that good depth mode looks like editing done in picasa bokeh mode is pure amateur you can apply better bokeh mode using photoshop my advice will be to go for nokia 6 i wish i had bought nokia
design perfect functionality perfect but major heating issue camera is also not that great and also normal 35mm jack head phones are not compatible with this phone jackvery worst productwhile recording video near back camera you can here a uncomfortable sound coming from mobile deviceif you keep flash light on for few seconds you can observe the heating issue
phone is good till now didnt faced any huge problems minor are there like battery doesnt goes up to the mark and mostly the main bad experience i got is it says helio x23 but in it its x20 its a type of fraud and also its not 55inches its 465 lenovo i have used k6 power its still my best mobile but this type of fraud behaviour you gone way down
quite impressivegud camera and sound qualityoverall gud phone for 14000
mobile is not good battery very problem 4000 match is not only 2000 mh power very heating mobile

very nice phone yar good battery üîã sustainability all apps are working
waste mobile poor futurea
display gone
i expected that ear phones given to it  but not given  however this worth of that price
awesome product good camera decent battery life best build quality everything is fine only the cons is device feels little more weight
not as expected rear second camera is a waste so many useful things are missing compared to k5 note
good mobile
the phone becomes very warmhot frequently
phone is a waste as it gets heated and amazon policy doesnt allow to return
amazing gadget in the price rangemusic key is extremely important function i foundfront camera looks very impressive but depth enable mode at the back expected to improve by lenovo in next updateone major advantage of this phone is water repellent and sustain bulk of water on screen and at the backlast but not least it has dolby atmos system for music lovers which really satisfy your investment in lenovo you jus need to buy some original branded earphones to experience the same
good product within the budget
good phone
this mobile is goodcamera quality is averageit is budget phone so do not expect more
performance is not good i heard that 4gb handset is better than 3gb handset but even this one is same also one of the speakers is not working
to much heating prblm
no battry backup no performance goodno featureslimited optionvery poor phone its only use a 64 gb sd card6000 rs me bhi koi olx par nahi le raha h
if you use it carefully it works fine one should understand the limitation of a mobile phone
lot of basic apps like gallery automatic call recordercontact manager etc missing from the mobile not satisfied with this basic mobile
excellant
battery not good
well yeah my brother bought it not less than a month ago from amazon itself and it explode not while charging or so but while kept in a pocket he bought its 4gb model none of it matters nowlenovo service support is pathetic even after five days now they are still finding their executive to talk with us on our written complaint forget about phone i am much worried about my brothers health his leg got severe burnsi am sharing the photos and my review so that people can be aware of it and one more thing no matter how good is your phone avoid keeping it in your pockets
good phone value for money

mast phonei have fallen in love
worst mobileit is heatingit will use for cooking egg amlets dont buy this
no use to take this phone better then take mia1 dnt take bzo amazon not given any exchange for mi
do not buy this phonei bought this phone on 25th flash sale received it on 27th and didnt even use it for 2 daysthough it is equipped with loads of features and good specs the battery is the worsta basic feature of any phone and this does not even have average battery life i thought first time usage requires hours of charging but it does not charge not less than 8 hours for 0 to 100 and i had to always keep the phone on chargingand the company promotes it as turbo chargingand moreover it drains fast and could not even last for 10 to 12 hours though its 4000 batterycamera performance is below average and overall performance is also poordont buy this seeing the killer features in reality it kills us with all its defects
excellent mobile with the price camera clarity is good
im also using lenovo p1 turbo and in comparison to the k8 note the features are are very minimal in the notesound is pathetic even with dolbyim using a jbl earphones a part from ram internal memory and camera the note has nothing special like in p1 turboopen for suggestions
excellent
i feeling disappointing about phone1 this phone has no default call recording2 no sellec all options in contact3 no nfc
very bad primary üì∑  quality vise is also worst
waste its dolby is not supporting and second camera is only used for depth
hii am totally not satisfied with lenovos k8 note mobile as it is a worst mobile with 4000mah battery which gives poor backup and the phones processing decacore is fake it seems because mobile is heating too much and the android system not working is a great issue as well as double tap and finger print clearly uselesswill suggest dont buy money waste if anyone purchase
nice one
good camera phonegood batteryvalue for money
phone is does not better
i change home address to office address but product delivered to home address
function well but camera quality isnt that much what i expected bcoz its 13 mp camera battery is draining to quickly compared to mi note 4
nice phone bukeh effect is not good but overall good one
the performance overall was okay but there was a lot of heating issues the biggest problem i faced was the poor battery performance the battery when fully charged didnt last for even 3 hours
i was given a preactivated product for the price of a new onealong with this very fast battery draining is a major problem
okay low budget and best future not bad
nice phone little bit hitting problem i loved it
not good
awesome product arrived quickly and works well
totally worse product do not buymost serious problem messagemailsms notification lighe is not working no option to off vibration when other end user pickup the phone no battery  shown in notification bar battery drain very fast with normal uses
overall good product camera quality is not as expected but its ok lenovo should work on heating problem of the phoneuserfriendy interface good battery backup speaker volume is loud n clear thanks to dolby atmos
compass  gallery options not availabledepth mode of camera very badbattery drain bahut fast hai
a good phone but horrible in terms of batterybattery is not as promised no turbochargepoor battery performance and the phone even lags in the beginning itselfbattery drain is pathetic hardly stands a daywhich is not as promisedcamera not that good woth too less features
it doesnt work in 4g mode signal strength is very week not recommended even they are not ready to replace the product
awesome phone with some added features as compare to previous lenovo handset as k6 or vibe or z2 plus this phone comes with one back cover which is an added advantage in this price range 
price to be performance is good
this phone is getting heated very fastly and the battery drains faster than k4 note and as the ram was 4 gb it should not hang but it hangs while using with more apps only one camera working lenovo broken the trust as i already used lenovo k4  vibe and lenovo phablet but this time im disappointed with lenovo 
corners little like edge dolby sound quality is perfect all features as given in description
its the best phone in low costone small thing is its some how heating while chargeit has borked screen within one month
i have received my phone yesterday  when we connect this with charger then got switch off and after remove the charger it will start
nice phone with nice battery life
not good experiencephone aaps open aoutomatically flash light open randomlybar menu scrolling down automaticallywhich kind of problem is thati dont knowi am customer of amezoni think they recognise problem and come with solutioneither phone replacement or repair
value for money

this is 2nd day of getting this mobile and heating is big problem also this is 4000 mah battery but seems it exhaust soon which as a result heats the mobile camera quality also not very exciting not worth as we can get better product in the same price range
a few very common features missing which is very strange1 you cant select any tune from your labs as a ringtone2 it doesnt support volte3 there is no screen mirroring4 phone gets hot after long usageall these features nowadays are available in lower phones but somehow lenovo has missed to provide any clue why
it is taking too long time in full charge ie 4 to 5 hoursits a bad performancesuresh kumawatbikaner rajasthan
decent camera good battery backup
very nice phone
having multiple issues with the phone not even customer service of lenovo is of any helpphone is having heating issues and jio is not working
good performance
nothing use of gorilla glass its single time drop from your hand definitely broken and if you going to replace the screen the lenovo authorization service centre ask rs8000mobile cost rs12999 but screen replacement cost almost 80 of the new mobile cost and service centre executive also refer you for buy a new onethink this reason then if want go for itno huge use of dual cameradual sim operation also some issue like 2nd sim is maximum disconnectedno new features like a redmi

this phone comes with lots of probleam and i am buy this phone only features for dual camera but i am not satisfied of this phone because secondary camera are not work in depth mode and clear photos as low light i hope the secondary camera is not any work heremy suggestion lenovo improve ur quality and featuresthere is nothing like what you are getting on the phones features if you are taking dual camera for a bad phone
major problem is phone chargingevery 12 hours it required chargingphotos are also not upto the mark
normal
device was delivered to me on 16th sept and with in a span of one week it had issue of restarting again and again while in usage in idle too approached the service center with the same they took 4 days of time and returned me back saying there wont be further issues but in less than two days of their service mobile started behaving the same still the mobile is in service centerfinally my suggestionbefore making a decision of buying a motorola  lenovo mobile please visit their service center near by by seeing the number of people carrying their new mobiles you can come to conclusion that its waste of money first then waste of time approaching them

very worst phone as promotion shows that beat the mi note 4  camera very poor  sound quality very bad  buy this phone only waste your money
great deal in 12k
i didnt get expected camera and screen mirroring option is their or not every thing is ok except this two options
nice
so good product
3rd class product from lenovo uoper camera not working its give only for look there is no upper cameraits only have one functional camera another is only for showoff
this device deserves a four star and has all the potential to be the killer if only lenovo could roll out a software update soon with mi a1 in the market with android one there is no way lenovo could chiken out on these bug fixesthough the performance is fast and fluid battery bugs relating to phone idle mild heating issues non functional dual camera is it just a gimmick dear lenovo you couldnt use the two sensors to deliver a real bokeh its just masking now let me down fix it with a software update lenovo gone are the spec games we need updates now
best phone on this price range

it is working fine except battery somehow fast charging minimize this factor but it feels that it is issue but everything else is absolutely ok
phone is working smooth and every specifications listed in description are correct and available in the deviceonly one speaker is embedded i dont know why every phone provides that another blank space of nothingbought on 4th october and package reached on 5th october so the delivery is fine and packaging was goodbut on 7th october the charging adapter got short from inside not working obviously looking forward to replace it from the service centrei will prefer this smartphone because its providing 2 rear camera for depth effect but not that much good at this price rangeit is truely a turning point of budget smartphones specifications adding 2 rear cameras in their list
good

very worst phone compare to lenovo k4 note  the back camera 13 mp  but no clear shot images are very blurred the k4 note is better than this camera the 4000 mah battery back up give only 6 to 7 hours when it fully chargedthe 6 to 7 hours back up also come when you use this mobile in normal usage like whats app facebook  mail checking if u watch youtube video the backup come only 4 hours the same heating issue also in this device  when call to anyone  i use loudspeaker or head phone only  bcz u cant use the mobile directly in your ear that much of heat was produced in this device 
heating issues its under moto launcher so lenova additional setting options are missing quite to improve software oriented issues
big heating problem
awesome
there is a lot of problem with network connection the mobile data and call connectivity are getting interrupted and disconnected frequently phone working performance is good camera is descent phones heats up frequently
the phone was good in every features but the battery was drining fast and not charging fast  it shows the turbo power connected but requires 4hrs to full chargeother than every features was good
i am a hard core lenovo user but this time i am not satisfiedi have got k8 note blue tooth issue music not clearservice center does not supportplz donot buy this product
an unstable product disappointed in this product restarting the phone is a major hassle frequently needs 34 attempts to start againpoor performance compared to k3 note which i purchased earlier and it is still in good working condition even after more than 2 years

average phone its over heating on charging spec all are ok but heating is too much
average phone there are better options out there in this price rangetouch gives occasionally problems also switching from wifi to mobile data does not work some times and need to toggle flight mode to get it working
nice phone

appears normal  heavy weight
poor battery life
camera is not as good as it boasts the dual camera feature is not that great giving 3 stars for the quick charge and battery back up alone
betry
my chargers not functioning properly take 18 hours to charge
really killerwhat pics dual camera
there are speakers in both sides of the charging portbut sound comes only from the right sideno sound in the left side speakersthis is a main issue i faceduel camera mode is fakecamera testi opened the camera and put my finger on the back top cameraat that time no obstruction is foundthen i turn on the depth mode and again put my finger on the top camera this time also nothing happened that means the top camera in the backside is only a dummy it is not at all working

i have been using this mobile for last 15 daysmost of the features are flawless but the only concern is that it gets heated up pretty fast even though i have updated to the latest software updatei hope they would rectify it soon
good service with nice product
this phone doesnt behave like it had describedi dont like much bt its okh n also it is lagging m giving this review after two days of use i hope itll give me a update to fix my all the problems i m refused to say that this is not such like lenovo says about that
v bad experience lenovo k8 notedue to moto marging
just one thing do not focus on some of the bastards who comment false stuff about things over here just go for it and one more thing its antutu and geek bench scores are even more then that of oneplus 3 dont believe it go check yourself
nice phone and worthy for cost compare to other devices best phone
i dont know after purchase of that mobile next day its price is reduced 1000 rs so i wanted to return that mobile
how to return this
worse product  poor battery
not as expected
ive had this phone for 5 weeks nowthe phone comes with a clear hard case im pissed my case came prescratched and strangely stained and no accessories except for the turbo charging adapterusb cable1 the primary camera is alright  i used to own a mi3 2014 and this compares with it which doesnt make it all that good for 2017 but good enough i havent tinkered with the depth enabled mode but i know it isnt flawless2 the phone may seem a bit too heavy the first day or two im just glad i havent dropped it on my face yet  3 the front camera is pretty good  all things considering  and wont make you look too ugly youll end up with bright adequate selfies4 i havent had any heating issues like other reviews have mentioned during heavy usage or while charging5 the battery life is great and will last you nearly the whole day unless you have the brightness on max the wifi is on sim is enabled and youre continuously watching videos6 although there is only one speaker ie only on the bottom thanks to dolby the sound is loud clear and pretty great7 the headphone jack is a tad annoying you really have to push your headphones in8 turbo charging   around 2 hours faster if you arent using the phone at all and its on airplane mode9 honestly stock android pisses me off im used to and love miui10 i got my phone in the very first flash sale aug 25 so i had to settle for the 3gb32gb version and its adequate11 the call quality is good enough12 this phone isnt all that great at catching wifi signals sometimes though my 2014 mi3 does betterall in all its a pretty good phone definitely wont let you down a lot when you really need it to come throughbut at this price range you could probably do better also keep in mind returning the phone will be next to impossible
dont buy any lenovo mobile in your life  i have visited lenovo service center 4 times in 5 months after puchase which i baught  13999 rupees but after 5 days it became dead after every few days continusly the service center guys are very rude and not cooperative after big disappointment i threw my mobile in dustbin for ever please please dont buy lenovo product

worst phone ever i did not even want to rate it a star the phone gets very much heated up and the the charging doesnt stay for long though theres a turbo charger with this device device is not worth taking better go for mi redmi note 4 they say mi blasts and heats upbut it is said only so that the mi market comes down its a cheap trick that are usually played by other competitors i bought lenovo k3 note a year ago and it has network issues that were never been corrected by the service centre and three months ago i bought another lenovo lenovo k8 note which is utter waste like k3 i gave my phone to service centre in jayanagar and instead of repairing it they broke the back cover of the phone which is non removable cover this was experience with this productso before you choose a product please do read the reviews

thanks
very bed product bt not working properly very much hanging  slow internet working  camera very bed very bed experience from amazon
nice phone bt battery back up is small compare to redmi camera is aswom
it has all the specs one needs in a 14k price bracket
battery life of this mobile is very badonly 56 hrs battery backupand its been 2 months since i bought it
device heats up a lot even when kept idle which leads to faster battery drainlenovo needs to sort this soonrest is good
very nice as per its price camera to battery all good
very super performancecamera quality is exxcelentbattery back up is very good
within 1 month of use started hangingone major draw back it does not support miracast function so you can not connect it to your smart tv surprisingly youtube can be shared with tv so they are forcing us to buy chromecast
this is not a standard lenovo phone no call recorder back button on opposite side
i love the phone 
this phone gets heated up very quickly there is no gallery video player or music player however googles photos and play music apps are pre installed as a substitute primary camera is good but the depth enabled mode does not work as it should we cant use zoom feature in depth enabled mode
really amazing
overall product is gud in performance camera is good battery drains much lasts one day on moderate useslight heating on chargeremaining all process r excellent
very slow process
cannot record calls battery is alright lasts more than a day
battery drains so fast and its not dual sim 4g  better go for other snapdragon processor phones
a
worst phone the dolby atmos is not working no data connection no wifi connection shows back light automatically lighten or brighten automatically closes appsfrequently phone hangsphone heats up i wish i could give 0 stars
camera is not good for low lightelse all things are very good
fantastic phone
overall good
very good phone in smart price
horrable performance with volte sim card poor coverage and always give message of switch off to remote person who is calling somany bugs in volte softwarecamera quality is not as per expectations what lenovo is claiming in advertisements camera response also very slowdepth mode is givien in camera but useless as after taking snap you have to edit photo and editing tool is also poor audio quality is average not satisfied not worth of money better handsets are available in same price
very disappointing  not up to the mark returns issue problematic only replacement possible but amount not refundable
best mobile in medium range money comparing with top company mobiles 
gorilla glassall other things are goodspeakers are good but it will give some low volume and there is nothing fault about lenovo k8 noteit is good in price with all features camera is to develop
both sims are not working 4 g slot 1 has not 4g option
at this price its worth buying when you compare with redmi series camera quality is not upto the level looks good only drawback is the turbo charger is not at all good it took 55hrs for the battery to full from 7 and no where its called turbo battery back up is little fine for 14k you cannot expect many featuresoverall its worthy
nice phone
glass breaks for a minor fall otherwise the product is good
bad phonewifi signal is poor not even caching wifi few steps far from the wifi device
really killer experience
no volte low signal catch do not buy this
got the mobile on first sale of the main aspect of the phone on which lenovo was emphasizing was dual rear cameras is not good at all the depth enabled mode is totally of no use neither is the depth editor all other aspect of the mobile is ok a honest suggestion is to wait for mi 5x or coolpad cool play 6  the web support of lenovo is also of no use raised a ticket on this issue still no answer or reply from them god knows whether they ever see to mails or not i made the mistake of buying this phone all of you out there please dont make my mistake
product is awesomedelivery is very good i thanks to amazon that they provide a back cover as free for my phone thanks for lenovo to front gorilla glass also

i has purchased lenovo k8 note in jan 2018 it was working perfectly fine a good phone for its worth lenovo rolled out the oreo update in may 2018 and after that my phone has almost been crippled the phone is taking 8 hours to get fully charged and the battery gets discharged in 5 hours it gets heated like anything and has also start lagging i have also done a factory reset as advised by the online customer care executive but it did not help hope lenovo releases an update soon

very bad camera quality with this price range  front camera capturing only mirror imageplz dont buy to see its deca core processor and 4gb ram  64 gb rom features if you want good photography mobile
tldr this phone sucks expected much better from the makers of moto even moto g5 is far better than thislong versionmy previous phone broke so i was in urgent need for a stopgap phone before waiting out for the price of lg g6 to drop shortlisted honor 6x lenovo z2 and lenovo k8 note bought this after 10 days of use here is what i thinkpros photos are decent compared to my last two phone that promised great camera but delivered little the bokeh effect is not as good and huaweis implementation no bloat it has stock android now stock androids blocky icons arent my favorite but you can change that with a launcher programmable music button i use that for turning on the flash light front flash dedicated sdcard slotcons lag despite a deca core processor and 4gb of ram this piece of fine machinery is lagging not on an intensive game like asphalt but clash royale even my moms redmi 3 will run that flawlessly battery another indicator that numbers dont always match the performance i gotta charge it twice a day and i miss fast charging notification led only white not red or green but only white no led flash for missed calls the most important use of that led software in many little ways the software seems much less integrated with the hardware compared to even moto
battery poor quality
nice
great phone worth lots more than what one pays for it
phone is goodsome function is missing as given in other lenovo mobiles like call recording internet speed meter phone call receive near ear etc
waste of money
looks good at design and all areas only needs improvement on battery no hanged till date camera is good
that 14k mobile when touch the back sensor screen lock open but again touch screen not locked  unwanted person when touching for sensor at screen unlock condition it was not locked  that future are there 10k worth of mobile moto e4plus
good one
waste phonepoor camera performance waste battery very poor gallery call recorder and so many applications are missing
worst phone possible  it is not working with 4g network  once calling the operator tried all options they say bring it to service center  do not buy this phone 
no hanging mobile i mean please purchase without any bad think
prompt deliveryvalue for money product
nice phone
waste products  it stop working suddenly  my all lenovo phone  working properly fine for 1st year and after that  we got major issue in screen  some time in it hardware it is better not to buy lenovo  or buy with extended warranty for 23 years good luck but better choice to buy other phones
think before you buy this product lots of setback but lenovo support team doesnt seem to think about it network and headphone volume is few of the major concerns as i cant return this now on amazon still waiting for an update that fixes few of the issues
good phone poor and limited ui
in display have a green color small dot in right sidei cant satisfied to but these mobile
very bad phone waste your money
internet is not working properly
updated review after posting it on 31st january for the updated issue read the last 2 pointsnote  the review is been posted after using this smartphone for 6 days after i bought it through amazon independence saledespite having such a wonderful hardware configuration in this smartphone there are lots of software bugs which ruined this phone even after the latest updates which i have listed below i hope lenovo provides a stable software through future updates 1 all incoming messages in the phone are delayed by 1020 minutes like all otp messages or any kind of messages which made me annoyed especially while doing bank transactions2 random power off issue phone gets randomly switch off while charging or while turning off the display by pressing lock button3 battery backup is very poor i guess this is a hardware issue not a software issue because phones like redmi note 4 gave me almost a full day battery backup has im a heavy user and this phone gave me 7 hours of battery life it seems like lenovo has cheated us by giving a label of 4000 mah battery backup which i think is only 2500 mah battery installed in this smartphone4 dual camera setup is just fake especially the depth mode from that 5 mp depth camera in short its just for name sake that this phone comes in dual camera setupas far i have encountered only these 4 issues if i face more issues will update my review till then go for mi a1 or redmi note 4 has per your budget atleast those phones have a stable software configured with their phones hardwareupdate 5 phone gets hang very badly while doing multi tasking though having deca core processor you can only run maximum 4 to 5 apps in background what a joke seriously right to overcome this hang one should do hard restart by pressing the power button for 10 to 20 seconds6 another software bug is with notification light which is single white colour no rgb notification light found in redmi note 4 but the true software bug is this notification light only works for pre installed applications on this phone that means notification light wont blink for third party applications like whatsapp hike etc but the notification light will blink for messages calls and gmail apps another software joke from lenovonote if i face more issues will update my review
this product is not for lenovo k8
better than many phone with a lot more price
this device is zero star rated wrost phone ever i trusted lenovo k8 note for moto branding owner but lenovo k8 note just wrost ever1 turbo power charge is just for show0 to 100 take 7 hrs to fully charge and when charging device get ultimate heats about 50‚ÑÉ and battery is wrost in phone idle battery last 5 hrs and always heat the phone main issue is the battery and charging issue  other wise phn is good u have always plug the phone in charging socket to use lenovo k8 made fools customer please dont buy this phone buy mi phone

waste of money and time brought this product recently not working properly with android 80 update phone is discharging in minutes and taking more than 7hrs hours to 100 charging while using the mobile its heating like a iron boxtotally hated the product then amazon replaced the product with a new device and again faced the same problemservice centres are also not answering properly one of my friends also brought the same phone before 3 months he updated the system to android oreo 80 and then the hell started in his device we went to the device centre and asked to take the backup of our personal data for resetting the phone we did it and handed over the device to them in the evening they called us and told that the problem was rectified and asked us to collect the device but the next day the problem repeated even more aggressively than earlier then we went again to the service centre and again explained the damn story then they changed the battery and gave us the phone back but the next day again the problem repeating so we finally went to them and asked them to replace the device with a new one but they said there is no such option to replace the defective problem and they can not help with the device problem finally one of the technician in the service centre told us that the problem is for all the k8 note devices after updating to android oreo 80 then we asked him to degrade the android version to nought 711 then he said they doesnt have the option to degrade the system update and told us that hell inform when the degrade option is available with them it has been 1 week since he told us but till now we didnt received any patch for this system update or degrading option so i suggest you guys please stay away of your thoughts of buying this producthave a good day
guysplease dont buy this phone it is totally waste of moneysome basic feature like screen casting also never worksno zero rating thats why rating with one star
getting heatedcamera quality too badtotally disappointed with this product
not upto the expectations
good
bakwaas phone
overall phone is goodbut the depth mode of camera is not working properly
dolby sound not as of dolbyexcept this every thing is good
everything else is good except camera they are trying to improve the camera by software update but the improvement is not up to the mark
good
its an overall good product but the oreo update isnt readyly available the 4000 mh battery is just there to support the 10 core processor it dies not give an extended battery life the mobile heats even on simple activities such as movies the mobile body is great as it is full metal the indepth mode is a just show
please dont buy this phone because of it is taking 8 hours to fill the battery  battery consumption also very more battery getting easlyy down
many issues with phone1 does not support call recording function neither third party apps2 dolby atmos doesnt work when called support they say every time clear cache and restart your phone3 phone does not support volte4 many third part apps not supported5 battery drains fast6 over heating sometimes makes you scarry7 phone speaker not of good quality sound cracks at 80 to 100 percent levelnormal ringtone also cracks8 no updates from lenovo to fix the issuesso a bad choice
nice 
excellentluv it
this phone is best phone its processor is greate and it works perfectly
every thing is nice here good battery stock android interface camera okay infact canera is better than redmi note 4 but okay with the price   never hangs no heating issues good fingerprint scanner fast processor what else we need at this priceüòÜ
i m not satisfied with my setit has issue with brightnessand clock is not showing correct timealso has heating issuei would not suggest to buy this set
not satisfied as phone doesnt have cast screen option to wireless connectivity with smart tv although other lesser value smartphones hv dis featurevery disappointedplus battery back up is worstreally bad
after using this mobile phone for one month i am writing this reviewthe main issue of this product is heatingduring charging or even using it for fifteen minutes raises the temperature by at least 10 kelvinthe turbo charger is not good enoughalso the touch buttons below the screen are not back litcamera is just average low light performance is very baddesign could have been better little bit thinner would be goodi think its just an experimental product from lenovoi dont suggest anyone to buy iti feel that lenovo should immediately stop selling this product and recall all of them from the market asapif there is any way to return it then kindly let me knowmi a1 is far better at the same price range
battery drain problem otherwise it is ok
lenovo k8 note is above from any other sub15k range smartphones from lenovo but average in overall ratings and little bit of heavy lill bit of heating with continues usage camera department is above of any other smartphones of this range but exception is its dual camera setup which is only a hardware setup in smartphone but software is not that much supportive wuth dual camera setup front flash is soft and quite goodstock android is impressive with itprocessor is not battery efficient as 4000mah not last long for a day 4000mah battery is good on paper but in day to day life it is somewhere 3200mahbuild and looks are impressiveled notification light is point to considerconsidering k8 note as a multimedia smartphone is fare ti rate it sound quality is good display experience is also good as welldual sim and dedicated sd card slot is nice effort with the fonededicated music key is good to have and ability to enable it for various operations is appreciablfingerprint security is only upto lock unlock but you cant let it to secure any of your apps without any 3rd party apps yes it works in capturing pictures through camerastock android is that much basic that even you cant hide apps in app drawer it looks good but feels little less that even yiu cant hide unnecessary apps
the phone is slow than lenovo k8 plus k8 plus is better
rear camera depth mode and bokeh effect is not up to mark as expectedheat up while turbo charging and gaming
its good
over heating issue while light usage like just in internet connection and always warm while connected to internet this update is after usage of 10 days dont prefer this one
good
nice phone
the screen is not like gorilla  its display broken very early
pros1 finally the camera is awesome in lenovo2 deisgn is not a merit but its okay for cost3 so far smooth performance didnt hangedcons1 if you are staying in hill stations as usual lenovo is carrying the exothermic mechanism which liberates enough heat to keep your hand extra warm2 turbo charging really works good but the bad thing is battery doesnt make you to feel 4000mah just stands for 5 to 6 hours of jio use3 stock os lacks lot of customization features that were available with earlier versions the os is just basic raw no value addition had been done4 lenovo should concentrate on network ic signal receiver never shows full tower so network consumes so much power i think so5 no headset i mean really this is absolutely madness6 speaker is of low quality
dont believe any fake review this is the best phone in this price range no heating problem no problem at all buy it as soon as possible
the mobile is not good as it is shown it has network problem also toch performance is poor
battery backup is average screen guard can not be install properly because of its corved display
received the used piece all the application were pre installed and you can see the images ive posted on aug 29 2017 received msg from vodafone customer carenote today only i received the mobile and last saturday i ordered the mob ie on 21st jan 2018before buying anything from this seller pls check weather you received the new product or the used one anyway ive raised the complaint regarding this let me see whats going to happen
theres no cast option in the phonewhich has to be present something seems wrong with the camerathe video doesnt have many options
handset is looking good camera is not so good its ok battery backup very poor ya i know there is big big ram latest processor but its too much drain fast while i am just whats app chatting and turbo charger is very slow it look like ordinary charger for 50 its took 5 hours and one more thing i dont have any kind of game or i m not playing it online but battery drain more than expectations its not worth price it is best for ‚Çπ 8000 max ‚Çπ 10999
amazon service is superb lenovo k8 note is an average product there is no inbuilt gallery in it and there is no more ringtone options of our choice other than inbuilt ringtones i am disappointed by purchasing this mobile
1charging issue taking 15 hours for full charging2 music button working as simultaneously3touch performance low4fast discharging not worth of 4000mah
the built quality is good and also the texture is fine but the main problem is the phone is lagging little bit and the dual cameradepth mode isnt goodnow come to the point 1 lagging  the phone start to lag after the first boot up when i was doing multitasking the phone start to lag the phone is running on android v711 nougat operating system with 23ghz helio x23 10core processor and 4gb64gb of ram though the phone is lagging so muchnow come to the second point 2 camera the front facing camera is good and the back camera is also good but the dual camera mode i mean the depth mode is very bad the dual camera couldnt recognise the item thats why it blurs the whole item and its the biggest problem in this phone though they are providing us a dslrlike depthoffield effect one camera has a 13 megapixel purecel plus sensor bringing in highend imaging capabilities the other has a 5 megapixel sensor which simultaneously captures depth information this means you can view realtime bokeh with up to f12
excellent product by lenovo4gb ram 64 gb rom  enough as per my requirementcamera is good picture quality is goodsound quality is also goodbattery life is okno problem with the phone as of now
very bad phone
display is not good
the phone has nothing except space i was way excited when i bought this but now totally disappointed and i was out of station for a week so was not able to return the phone so nothing is good on the phone except you will get space i was using k4 note before which is far better than which leads me to buy this but now i am totally disappointed with this1 heating issue2 camera quality ok ok3 nothing special about this phonedont go for this

good
worst product
k 8 is third class phone k4 and k5 is batter phone but k 8 is very cheap phone in this series no any sensor no call record  no smart call receiver
this phone is hyped as a decacore high performing phone but in reality my old k5 note is faster two major problems that i noticed so far  audio on bluetooth breaks up very frequently and this is not isolated to my phone  do a quick search on lenovo forums and youll see that this bug is in every k8 note and lenovo hasnt bothered to fix this also if you plan to screencast  youre in for a surprise this feature isnt there and youll need chromecast to screencast  lenovo says that this is as per design this is not because of a hardware limitation some people have enabled this feature by rooting their phone and adding some 3 lines of code which lenovo can add easily only because google wants to promote chromecast this has been removed
big disappointment very normal phone except front camera bluetooth connectivity is worst display quality is very normal
mast jazabbattery not up to the mark rest perfect in 11 k

average battery barely goes over a day ui is smooth and very fluid a bit heavy to hold camera fails to start but when it does its average depth mode is a scam any third party app can do that better even dolby atmos sounds gimmicky apps load quick but dosent stay in the memory out of 4gb after 3 weeks and some basic apps im getting around 1gb free poor app management i wish i could get a refund had high hopes from a company like lenovo
mobile lenovo k8 note 4gb ram  is the best mobile in low price all fiture is good
battery not that good not last for 12 hours in medium useno galleryno ear phone ear phone socket is hard to push and pull ear phone ear phone sound quality is not goodram is showing 63 lots of bloatware delivery is very slow waited for a whole day despite it has reached my area at morning 9 am amazon transport service is slow
worst plz do not buy weak lte signal also forget about bluetooth audio it will biffer in any headset
i think best
this is best phone but 1 problem i faced that the company has installed media tech which is not good for high graphic game it started lagging and heats up the temp gone up to 45¬∞and thats not good but else if u dont play games the no other phone is best then this it have best camera dolby  front flash and many more thingsi request to lenovo that please use snapdragon 
its the worst phone i have ever seen  the camera is not working properly there is always a network problem and while calling the voice is always broken  and you are not refunding me for that phone  i promise that i will never buy any product from this site üò≠üò≠ i want my refund

its ok ok since after a period of six month this phone has stopped working after six month mobile stopped working while it was charging but centre asking for repair of this mobile rs12000 as they opened the phone at the centre without our presence and they told us that it has been damaged duty to water but i m 100 sure this is false and fabricated and centre making money by levelling anything whatever they want by any means to make money this is harassment of customers of amazon and in future i will not by electronics gazzets through amazon in fact now i will prefer to buy physically through store so that they will repair it all online buyers getting harassed by these service centre

product warranty is listed as 235 days despite of purchasing it yesterday on 05may18product not matching the performance or quality as described facing issues with battery performance after available update of oreo android 80  battery charging is taking a lot of time  in 1 hour there is only 10 charging for phone the drain time is drastically more in comparison to charge time
processor is quite powerful which does great job and phone doesnt hang even on heavy usage but down side is it consumes more battery which feels 4000 mah as ok option rather than great camera quality is good overall deserves 5 star
this is very highly reputed company and also 12999 rs cost of mobile but handsfree not available with this phone in the box so bad
so so
charger very bery bad
there are lots of problems in this product  lenovo k8 note1 its look like second rear camera is not working in depth mode2 mobile gets hang3 battery discharges to 0 directly after 20 left

i was excited with my k8but my expectations were wrongmainly phone gets heat4g signal strength could not able to getback camera is not as good asphoto gallery is missingbattery percentage is missingsms always ask sim is missingi doubt speed as welloverall not happy
sir ji mobile ka bil gum ho gya dusra bill chahiya tha kyuki charger krab ho gya please help
not up to expectations its okay main pros includes dual sim slot and separate slot for memory card n good internal memory n ram main cons are over heating issues and battery drains out at a faster rate but can be managed with a turbo charger
worst rare camera
overall good performancedrawback customize ringtone not able to set

very good quality phone and shipping is awesome fast
the best phone i ever purchased great specifications at an affordable price i have been using lenovo k4 note since last year january and this is a good upgrade great looks great battery backup and great picture quality
good
very good product
this mobile is bad
first time very bad experience with lenovo bad display quality no gorilla glass protection scratches coming on display and important app are missing like gallery and many moreim boycotting lenovo
this is the first time i am reviewing a mobile as i wanted to help the others before buying this phone this phone is good for a budget of 14k i have bought 64gb 4gb ram model after a week usage i see the ram speed browsing net switching to different apps is really fast no doubt the interface on android ver7 its a great user experience but there is a major problem with the battery as plenty of them have mentioned on their comments lenovo claims it is turbo charging but it takes minimum of 2 hours to charge or sometimes it varies close to 3 hours as well battery draining quickly is a terrible product defect i have an issue when the battery indicator level comes to 15 it goes to 2 in less than 3 minutes and it shuts down i have highlighted the issue with a video evidence to amazon and fighting for a replacement of phone or refund not sure if the same battery issue repeats to my replacement phone as well i am also planning to post a video of this issue in youtube in general a 4000 mah capacity battery should stand for at least 2 days with a minimum usage or 15 days with a decent usage but seeing the comments from most of buyers i think this is a manufacturing defect and lenovo should really see this issue get it addressed immediately if you ask my opinion wait for few days revisit the new comments posted by the buyers and once the battery issue stands resolved then go for it end of the day whats the point of buying a mobile with a battery issues its like buying a vehicle with fuel injection issues it will not last long
worst phone damaged  heating issuecamera worst
awesome service excellent product
not so good  lenovo a6000 plus is better
i have ordered it on 18th august at 1201 pm got it on 19th really nice the amazon delivery and overall phone is good but i have a question that will camera quality better with the next update

the product is faulty amazon is cheating its customers as it is becoming popular in india they refused to replace my faulty device microphone is not working properlynot at all satisfied with this purchase will think twice now before purchasing smartphones from amazonall my trust level on amazon has became zero after this order
battery drains too fast even if its kept idle and it does not support auto record during phone calls
no charging but over heat
camera performance is very 3rd class
its too good
very nice phone
good one but little heating
love this item
cant believe that also by amazon its a rainy season and still they dont care though deliver was delayed due to flood its acceptableproducts was safe due to plastic coating by lenovo 5star to them because of them product was safe not because of amazonrating 1star for amazon and 5star for lenovo
cast function not working i called to customer care they asked me that i have to purchase one cast modem for functioning cast optioni really felt disappointedbattery draining problemmobile heatingbad product dont purchase

i was using lumia 730 and wanted to switch to an android phone at lasti chose this phone based on the hype and the specs it comes withoverall the phone is good but i felt whatever was promised on its ad by lenovo wasnt there in real the phone is laggy even in normal usage quite a few times despite the hype of it 10 core processor not good for high end games i mean i use normal games like 8ball pool and this phone couldnt even run that game smoothly and felt glitches and lags every time during the gameplay and spoiled the experience of it my iphone 4s plays better 8ball pool better then this phonebeing a normal user i ignored it and now lets talk about the camera the shutter speed of clicking the pictures is the worst i have seen and the quality of pictures isnt that great it felt like a high end vga camera and the panorama pictures are the worst  worsti dont know what the youtube reviewers saw in it for their biased reviews2 stars from my side for it
im not seate fid is lenovo k8 note
nice mobile at this price  good camera clearity dolby music experience is awsm
cost worthy good battery backup camera quality good during day time and poor at night major disadvantage is notification led is not glowing for 3rd party applications such as whatsapp messanger hike since its the known issue till the product release there is no fix found for this that is the only saddest part about this product
heating issue is there after continues usage photo clarity is average battery too is not up to the mark but still manageable
dont buy very bad headsetworst quality very heating and hanging

i am writing this review after using almost 10 months before i was using moto g2 which was good but became old and slow overtime then i wanted to buy better phone with good camera the specs of lenovo k8 note tempted me to buy mainly duel camera and fast charging i was expecting better camera phone but disappointed a bit and could not achieve my goal  overall phone rating is average
defective product provided by amazon
i am posting this review after a week of usagefirst of all lots of people problem is to go with this one or redmi note 4  so i have used both the device  the only difference between this one and rn4 is battery backup  youll get around 8 hours of sot in rn4 but only around 5 to 6 hours in k8 noteother than that all the aspects are definitely better in k8 note and there is also fast charging in this one which charges fully in 2 hours without using the device if you are using then definitely charging will be much slowerif we consider k8 note alonepros aredual camera if only there is an update in future to improvefast chargingdisplay all mobiles in this price segment maybe fhd but this one is slightly betterdolby atmosstock android superb fluidity definitely lenovo done a great job by removing their ui and goes with stocktheatre max  if u are person who is watching lots of hollywood movies this is best featurecons arei experiencing heating issue while charging and playing but not too much i think its manageabledifference in battery backup  sometimes im getting 6 hours of sot and sometimes around 4 to 5 hours but i suggest you to install greenify for more better battery backupunwanted second camera if there is no further updates for camerathose are the cons i found till nowfinally there are the problems like camera and battery but those can be solved via ota so i am eagerly waiting for updatesfor 14k ill definitely suggest this one over rn4  moto g5 plus and honor 6xim disappointed now that is more than a month no proper update for camera and battery backup is getting worseso i suggest u guys to ignore this one
fantastic

i purchased this phone recently the phone having the good camera quality and also provides very good photo features however it is having bluetooth related issues i connected this phone to my car via bluetooth and observed the bluetooth connectivity the bluetooth was getting disconnected continuously while listening to music as well as during phone calls
overall is good
phone is awesome works very smoothlybut it takes time to boot both cameras are perfect in 14k its mind blowing
performance of the phone doesnt match the product descriptiondo not waste your money on this and customer service is also as bad as they phone and they perfectly match each other and didnt take my complaint or issue even after receiving the product

cons1 camera is protruding and is getting scratches even after using cheap plastic cover provided with the set2 metal body is very slippery3 my k4 note delivered better sound than new k84 camera fails to identify subject in depth mode making it very difficult to use the depth features5 lots of features of on screen display r not present making less informative6 heavyin about 10 days of use i and feeling a little disappointed to choose this model
previously it was a good phone for multipurpose use but after new software update everything has become worsemain issue battery drain full of bugs many apps not working properly picture quality become dull performance become blunt
nice best one
very good
most importantly battery backup is less than mi note 3but as lenovo commitment about battery backup is totally wrong pic quality also not much bettereven mi note 4 better in overall viewonly one factor is good its dolby sounds
bad camera the dual cam does not work properlyit doesnt make the background blurry  background changes in a good way
there are multiple issues with this lenovo k8 model  it is even matching the performance of previous lenovo phone models1 sim slot 1 is does not have 4g support2 even if i stand under a open parking slot or some shady area  phone does not catch he 4g coverage that also in bangalore main city locations3 battery does not even run for one complete day  even though they claiming high ma battery on it4 phone get heat even we speak for 3 min i am totally unsatisfied with this phone model and really thinking for throwing away because of poor antenna and network coverage issues

very problematic phonedoes heating ishue
i am posting this review after 3 months of usageinitially the phone looked good but as i started using i found many problems1 if you go to contacts and click on any contact the screen goes blank and you cant open the contact2 mirroring function is not there so if you want to do mirroring on your tv or projector its not possible3 bluetooth doesnt work the phone is not searchable by any other bluetooth device or it cant search any active bluetooth device4 camara is ok nothing great to have duar camara at the back and front camara has average result5 charging takes long time in some sockets dont know why6 front sensorts are not that greatmy overall verdict is if you can get a better option at this price then go for it
the phones primary camera is poor after the snap is clicked the photos look dull the phone does not come with call recording feature inbuilt as well as third party app only records self voice the phone is not worth the price is neither comparable to redmi note 4
battery is very vest
very good product battery backup is very good nice looking smooth touch only camera quality and sound quality not up to the mark specially the sound quality is very poor k5 note sound quality is far better than k8 note sound quality
the best specs in its category with the best available price 2nd consecutive lenovo brand purchase for self use reliable brand
very poor material
this divas is very bed and most hit
heating problem
nice one
in my opinion the device is great then other devices but battery is not working like 4000mah
super
good phone but camera isnt too good so better go for new phones k8 is old already
prosgood display speaker battery lifecamerasplit screen is interesting but several apps are not supported on itcons no earphones in the box turbo charger takes up to 45 mins to fully charge the phone as opposed to advertised 15 minsgood for users who are looking for budget phones with good camera and using it for organising their work etcthe lack of earphones makes it not so enjoyable for watching movies  videos inspite of a good display
not worth of its money
dont buy this phone has heating issue try ur luck if u want and may be this works good for u amazon return policy is very bad for mobile device once u complain for defective product they will block ur number and u wont be able to call them again for replacement or refund u will have to write mails for which no revert will come in return option they will ask to install an app which will always tell that ur phone is ok my sincere suggestion is that dont buy from amazon any mobile device i appreciate flipkart or snapdel as they return without any question if ur product is not good my phone touches 40degree when i start taking and they since the temperature is less than 48 its ok for use nonsense
nice phone

bad experience battery decharging quickly and it takes too much time to charge
phones are getting slimmer but bend are not covered in warrentyafter using the phone for 4 months a huge bend occur in the handset but service center saying bend problem is not covered in warrenty hence cannot helpso my question is for lenovo why company is making thinner mobiles with big screen if customer are facing this type of problem and if company will continue doing so the bend problem should also covered in warrentybad experiancemore over my vol  button stoped working and after rushing to service center i come to know that it get broken and service center denied to replace the same in warrenty and giving bull shit reason that its damage hence not covered in warrentyso my question is what is covered in warrentyi could have give 5 stars if option availablethink 1000 times before buying lenovo product because there was lots of people like me struglling to get their mobiles repaired under warrenty
awesome phone reasonable and effective i alwaz recommend this product
huge network issue with this model
dont look for hardware but software version used by lenovo on this k8 note model is worst this software has lack basic functionalities like theme and other basic features you can find in samsung even cast option is not working defect in the latest operating system no change in handling this mobile even k4 note is better than k8 note i have upgraded this mobile to latest nogut os version 711 but no help and future version 80 oreio will available in next diwali 2018 so there is no effort by lenovo worst quality product by lenovo better to go for samsung
performance not as expected lots of bugs for blutooth many times hangs while playing games less frequent updates screen burning is another issue
dont buy this phone from amazonafter purchaseing a lot of problem occured like battery back up too weakheating issue not solved and headphone not supporti had mailed on amazon with service report card but no helpful reply from themthey do not returnreplace this itemtoo much worst experience from amazonnever purchase electronic items like mobile or tablet from amazon
good battery performance delivers a full day of duty for a relatively high usage of mail box net usage and social surfing response of the os and equipment is in line with the expectation speakers are good after the stunning results i get on my motoz it is only natural that i do it find the results of the camera in line with my expectation  overall a fantastic value for money 
superb

good battery back up and works as expected
very handy and upto date phone but nfc option is not there otherwise best phone in 2017
outstanding look very fast touch long lasting battery and every device is connected  capacity very high and many more function  just try it
display not working properly even before one year break the display
nice phone thank amazon
it was mentioned in the reviews that this product has turbo charging but this charger seems to be the slowest charger i have ever seen dual camera doesnt seem to be working as the other phones with dual camera works
this phone has lots of spacebut it heats due to mediatek processor
poor camera resultnot much user friendly
good
great phone for the price we are paying even heating problems also seems to solved and selfis are also great
phone was delivered almost on time as committed i found it to be good and value for money product
slight heating battery capacity is not perfectand the system update will not work it will notify anad i also proseed to updatebut no changes occurworst on system updategive me clear answer on system update
its really good
hardly use of 30 mins n the phone gets hot battery dont last long on full charge even though its 4000 mah alarm does not work when phone is shut off using mi4a also much better phone
heating problem battery back up poor takes 8 hrs to get charge third class product dont waste money
its one of the best smartphone but due to mediatek processor it gets over heated when in use for long or playing any high end games like pubgi wished lenovo may have used a powerful qualcomm snapdragon processor
good phone in best price
worst product ever battery is draining out and camera is not upto mark amazon is cheating here trying to return the product but not giving option bye bye amazonplease dont buy any phone from amazon delivery is faster but once you get the phone no one is going to listen you

phone is okbut battery charging time from 0 to 100 is not less than 2 hours it takes more than 2 hoursdual camera feature need to be improved and phone battery doesnt last for the whole daywaiting for an update for 1 better battery life2 lesser charging time3 improved cameras
charger not working properly it takes 8 hours to full charge mobile 
battery backup very bad
very cheap security given no app lock when you on hotspot how many person connected to your hotspot doesnt display even which person you wants to block is also not displaying and other things are good but its security level isnt good
its heating like hell dont buy it lenovo should need improvement hanging issues camera is like im using mp camera battery draining fast i loved previous lenovos k4 note phone before but now they changed their products quality also their service centres staff are not professional they dont have even basic knowledge about possible issues in phones and they compare service with samsung and iphone lol
best in camera
how it is connected with pc

i m use this phone is very good handlingperformance camera quality is also good
ive been using the mobile for 8 days now and its better in every way the only issue i felt so far is that it switched off all by itself twice in this mean time that too after charging it full hope this will be rectified in the next software update thank you

not very impressed with the phone it lacks so many settings and options for example1 it does not show the devices connected to it when hotspot is turned on2 there is no option on the pull uppull down menus to control vibrationringing you have to use the volume button to mute the ringer3 you cant change the lock screen wall paper4 one has to tap twice to open up a link on the page when browser is used5 since the speaker is at the bottom of the phone when you put a call on speaker the experience is very annoying6 does not have black screen smart gestures7 it is extremely heavy tooits supposed to be the 8th update of the knote series by lenovo but functionality wise it seems to be such a basic phonealthough the phone does not lag and charging is pretty quick
brand new phone purchased received on 28th august 2017 and there are lots of issues with this phone on the first day itself not getting charged bluetooth not working wifi not working portable hotspot not working there are issues with cpu when i use usb tethering the phone battery actually reduces instead of charging up or staying stable phone heats up a lot which they will say its normal there might be even more faults with it which i may have not discovered as i havent used this phone much as i received it only three days ago and havent had chance to explore it morenot even happy with the service of amazon india  extremely disappointeddoesnt give me confidence to buy anything form amazon anymore with the type of service i received

worst mobile pls  dont buy this phone
i didnt get any phone acessories except mobile charger
ossom phone value for money
i will never recommend to buy this product from amazon it started giving problem after 20 days and amazon has refused to accept the return policy as their so called return window was closed when i visited customer service center they informed me as there is a display problem you have to pay 5000 for repairing this means that the phone was defective which amazon supplied to me
1 though advertised as jio compatible being lte does not work with jio sim most of the time we have made 3 visits to jio and after that sometimes it works sometimes not sometimes jio calls work sometimes jionet sometimes neither you want a phone with 2 sims and it should be dependable but not this one you cannot trust it and take it with you and be sure that you can makereceive a call when you want it2 turbo charging does not work  of course with the charger and the cable provided3 heats up quite a lot gets very hot even when not in userecommendation do not buy till lenovo fixes these
not good

good phone but bit overpriced internet is full of reviews and specs so will not repeat it following is the list of pros and cons from mysidecons 1 gets warm while playing simple games like candy crush tho no problem watching videos and listening to music2 personally i didnt find stock android os that great i am in favour of few customization and features options from manufaturer customization options are very limited major put off for me3 unread message badge counter for notification is missing so if ur phone is on silent and u hv disabled notification u wont b able to know how many messages are unread in whatsapp sms facebook etc you hv to manually open the each app and check the status now and then4 no separate option for monitering call and message notifications ringtone if u lower or mute call ringtone message tone would also be reduced or mute as the case may be5 no ultra power saving mode option6 no nfc infrared ir blaster and screen mirror options7 key board typing is not so smooth and lot of time i hv to edit wht i keep typing at high speed8 double tap to wake phone takes time9 battery hogging even being 4000 mph battery it runs out in 78 hours flat compared to redmi note 4 which gives more than a day battery life10 very heavy n bulky feels like u r carrying a small iron rod in the pocketpros1 blazing fast speed to open and manage all apps2 premium look with all metal finish3 display panel excellent4 no hybrid sim slot means u can use 2 sims and one memory card5 good ram management6 dedicated music key with customization optionpersonally i would not recommend this pure stock android phone to anyone better options like redmi note 4 moto g5  with similar specs available
worst product
bought this in sep 2017 performed well for some months then it started acting weird proximity sensors dont seem to work sometimes contacts and phone app get stuck a lot touch screen becomes unresponsive sometimes have to restart the phone many times in a day
guys i am an engineer so writing this review after long study phone hardware is absolutely awesome however this is stock android so you cant expect extra lenovo need to change this looking for updates soon function like screen casting is not working some software issue need to fix but overall hardware is really good
phone overall is ok but camera performance average
very bad you have cheated the product has so many software complaints from the first day itself dolby doesnt work on playing music the sound quality is very worst when comparing with my friends lenovo k8 note worthless product waste of time and money pls dont buy this product from amazon they are giving offers to attract us

i brought a lenovo k8 note fine gold 64 gb n 4gb ram but i am totally disappointed after purchase this product as this product is not up to the marks if we thinking about lenovo productsmy lenovo mobile screen is cracked just after 2 days of purchase and i cant believe its screen is crackedbroken while dwon at floor just from 12 feet of heightwhat is purpose of gorilla glass that is claimed by lenovo because either it is not a original gorilla glass or lenovo making fool to thier customeri am tried to call lenovo customer caseservice center and as per them new screen cost is 40of the mrp ie approx 6000other disappointed things seems in lenovo k8 note it is over heating problem and also its heat when ph is charging thats very bad thing for lenovodull screen weak networkdolby audio is only strategy by lenovo for selling purposes
earphone issue  sound quality is low nd bad in earphone earphone does not fully enter the point nd because of that many times music stops plzzzzz fix this

super ga vundi
after 10 days of use charger works not properlyin the beginning it took 15 hrs to chargenow it takes more than 215 hrs to chargeat some time the charger is not connectednow it takes 3hrs to chargesame issue comes to another buyernd also battery life is not so goodwith heavy use last up to 89 hrswith mormal use 1213 hrsafter further use the turbo cahrger stops workingbattery life sucks
this a good mobile and having great performance
perfect phone with everything fine the problem is the battery life being a 4000mah battery and not running for a whole day with moderate use also the rear dual camera depth enabled pics are not that catchy as other phones in the range
after the update the phones battery has started to drain very quickly and while charging it gets very hotand sometimes it lags tooo
battery back up is very poor not even one day will stand in regular usage with out switch on data and turbo charging will more then 2 hours to charge and other performance is good and very draw back for the phone is battery
main problem call recorder iz not working in this very bad thingüòûall over performance averagecamera gud but low light very bad experience ‚òπÔ∏èbattery averageprocessor okdisplay touch gudgoogle assistant gud

bluetooth not workingfingerprint sensor averagego for another onerear flash also not good
there are many features missing which lenovo had in its older models for eg in a7000 had waving  blink to take selfiees notifications bar had many system ui icons such as night mode etc which is missing in k8 note
its a great phone
with lot of expectations went for the phonethe finish was so good and it was light weight the android 7 was neat and the phone didnt face any lagging or heating during my initial usethe disappointment was more on the turbo charging and especially on the camera the turbo charging was not as quick as i had expected so that was a bit disappointing still a decent speed and we can live by itthe camera experience was one of the worst that i have come across in the five years i am not sure if it was a bad piece i received or k8 note itself is of such low quality in past i have used nexus 5 meizu note 2 redmi note 3 and moto g4 plus and when compared to those mobiles the camera specifications were a bit high in this one of the major reasons i went for this one was for the camera specs it boasted of sadly all pics either in depth mode hdr or even normal mode were of very very low quality i would rate the camera 110if you are not worried about the camera then you can go for it i have returned my phone alreadyps again i am not sure if my piece was a fault one but as far as my experince goes this is a total waste of money purely for the worst camera experince
before updating this phone to 80 oreo it is the best phone but now it is not functioning properlyyou feel useless
nice phone in this range
best phone in this range for gaming ‚ò∫Ô∏è
phone turn off while using  when gets truns on the fingerprint scanner doesnt work then difficult to replace or return the phone
phone is over heating
awesome mobile suber performance
superb phone with nice smooth curved edges which gives a good hold and comfort rather than firm and sharp edges performance makes this phone worthyn also its protective gorilla glass of top quality and splash resistance nano coating technology and android 7 makes gives the final touch happy with my first lenovothanx amazon
best phone for this budget
battery backup is very very bad
nice mobile good config
over heating issue
no super pover save mode k5 note is best then k8 note hedset sound is not at all good and sigle strength is very poor
phone is so much hittingcamera is not working properlyworst phone
camera and speakers not up to standard build quality could have been better too there is a considerable lag when you play games not the best phone from lenovo
lenovo and motorola has variety but aftersellsservice is very very badmost of lenovo phones problem is touch or pda fai
not as expected
good battery backupüòô
no recording feature and no headphones provided as with previous lenova phones provided headphones
timely delivery product exactly as per description packaging good lenovo k8 note after using it for 4 days is excellent  economical as compared to vivo v5 plus rs 15999 old price and samsung s8 plus rs 58500lenovo k8 note venom black 4gb with new system update
its not dual standby 4g4g its a 4g3gwhen i insert jio sim and trying to video call via phone dialer its not supported require jio 4g voice app then working  while lenovo claiming on amazon website that its a voice over lte  so before buying know about this factit seems like lenovo is cheating only
good phone at this price range
some software issue is there in this phone other wise it a killer
nice phone but i regret the price for which i purchased it after a month of my purchase it dropped on some online platforms to 70 of what i paid here
satisfied with productbut i am dissatisfied with some of futures not therelike1main bug is cant able to save contacts in phone memory2 some of futures are not there in notification center and status bar like main options are lock screenshot buttons not there3 there is no option to display internet speed and batterydue these bugs i am giving 3 rating i am expecting that vendor will provide update by adding these or some of futures

the drop down does not work properly keeps hanging scolling is not as good as the older phones i am very disappointedbluetooth pairing issues very average camera

i have purchase lenovo k8 fine gold mobile on 12th october2017 on emi but suddenly comming from job my mobile is theft in train i have doing insurance on this product give some information about them
awesome phone
camera is not good enough
spellbound
no good phone do not waste your money mic was not working out of the box really pathetic
i got with discount and in that price i got a good phone  camera quality if pretty good  video in day light is awesome  battery is ok ok but design can be betterone major con is lenovo service is pathetic none of updates are coming is this phone
phone is no doubt good but battery should have been of 5000 to 6000 mah
its display has not clearitiyand battery backup not enough
am i theonly one who is facing issue with left speaker 
the best phone
only heating problem while using internetexcept this mobile is good
good mobile
good performancequick charginggood battery backupbut camera is average
performance and camera are as mentioned its a killerturbo charger is effective since its charging 4000mah battery in 90mins thats way coolthe things is the processor since its a 10core mediatek processor it consumes energy to perform so battery backup is not so effectivebut in idle condition without internet it comes around 18hours backupthose who expects performance then battery its a sure go mobilereview placed after 15days of usage
i just buy 2 weeks ago now i have to charge full night to get 100 percent i dont know whats the issue
value for money in this budjet
best phone  the power full smartphine
nice phoneand i got this phone in 2 days
multiple issues with softwares
network issues
i have purchased lenovo k8 note this product is really disappointed me it is missing the basic cast future even 4000 rupees mobile is having this feature but lenovo is missing this basic concept they are suggesting to purchase a chromecast to cast the screen it is not worth because recently every tv is coming with the smart future with advanced features in built for the casting lenovo has to take it on priority and need to release the update with out cast feature this mobile is really waste of money and better to choose other mobile
this has no recorder worse it doesnt have the facility for even a third party twoway recording app which i require for professional work why couldnt this company even mention that it doesnt have a recorder like its previous products  felt cheated
battery life is very poor issues with software within few days of purchase itself very bad experienceit is not even a month since purchase there is no option to even return or replace the phone
good phone im satisfied with this phone services
it‚Äôs software is not common of all other indian mobiles very different we can‚Äôt follow

well the phone quality is quite good but somehow lenovo has missed out on most elementary and basic feature of turning lights on for three soft navigation keys gets difficult to navigate  the company advised the phone is configured that way suggestion or solutions and feedback are most welcome thank you
lenovo has deteriorated its qualitylooks like they selling refurb product from chinathis coat 40 higher in chinahow come they are selling at such a low price that too after importing from chinalot of performance issuesnot a reliable mobilei bought two in my house and both have problem started in 3 months
lenovo k8 note is nice but camera and battery is not up to mark even fm radio has very low sound i could have been more better
using this product last 7 month awasome phone awasome camera everything is first class dont think to much just buy it 
awesome mobile totally loved itevery feature is perfect and performance is brilliantmain drawback is the heating issues its getting heat so early
great budget phone of this year 2017camera quality is very good sound quality is excellent and performance is good best stock android phone best selfie good battery life
good phonevalue for moneyonly the usage of the dual camera setup could have been better
getting over heat high price after purchase price down
worst phone i had ever come across mediatek processor sucks heavily could not even handle nfs most wanted overheating all the time and battery drained very fast in standby let alone usage best specs but worst processor made this the worst one
superb fon camera awesome featuresphone working awesome i love lenovo k8 note
too hanging problem without non storing any thingsnetwork connectivity problemduring call we cant scroll top iconsbattery very poor like a 2000 mah battery total software problem shortcut music key not functioning i put replace query they accept by sending the technical people to my end for verifying all the above and updated bout the phone they accept to replace or return money but till they not collect the phone for replace policy for you all here i attach the technical person given report about the mobile for you all

i bought this awesome mobile initially i bought a lenovo k3 note and i had some issues like heating problem and phone hanging during playing games now i bought lenovo k8 killer note by the name itselfit showcases the power of this mobile i am using it over 3 months and i am damn sure its a very good android phone also its performance is very good
pathetic phone over heating even with moderate use in just 5 minutes the device heats up camera is rubish just a gimmick for dual camera tv screen cast does not work battery drains like an open tap with with flowing water the only thing which is good is the the dolby atmos thats it rest all sucks would not recommend anyone to take this phone
nice
excellent phon
not better with redmi phone
lenovo k8 note main problem is heating even normal internet searching phone get worm quickly  also worm quickly during watching movies
first 10 days u will feel that it is best but after some days u will find promblems like intense heatingno fast chargingand fast battery draining

cast function not working with update battery life has shorten
good
nice product service is very good
2 star less for showing fake idea offer with this product
the note 8 is a real disappointment the bluetooth is of very poor quality just doesnt maintain constant connection beside having intermittent static  there is no great improvement over k5 note in terms of displace and connectivityoverall a poorer version of k5 notelenovo need to if required recall the k8 to fix the bluetooth issue all
phone seems to give good performance but it lacks in better sound quality even after having dolby sound is too low may be hardware problem overall its a good buy
it dont give me a charger of mobile and i receive it 23 november
mobile is getting hot frequently when tried to return the product amazon portal advising to contact mobile tech support
good
if you want use 4g sim in both slots you will be disappointed üòü otherwise phone is good
not worth
i think lg q 6 is better then this 
video calling is not good
rather than battery backup i am satisfied with other things in this mobile although i kept my phone in idle condition almost 5of power is consuming every hour
volte wont work in battery saver modeit was advertised as 4g  4g phone it is not true one sim can be used as 4g sim and other sim has to be on 3g or 2g networksignal strength is not good compared to owned redmi note 3 nexus 5 and zenfone 2dolby atmos stops working if you install any other music playerit gets switched off after charging used to charge at night and found it gets switched off every dayi installed battery temp monitor software it gets too much hot 40 deg c while playing games and while on charging and remain hot for normal use compare to owned redmi note 3 nexus 5 and zenfone 2i dont see any use of booster charger it takes too much time to charge the phonefinally i returned the the product it is not easy to return the product on amazon unless u have hardware fault and for that technician visit is needed
hi i am using lenovo k8note very poor ui many features are not availableand improper response from lenovo support

what i didnt like this cell phone was running smooth till the time i started getting updatesafter the recent updates  specially after theandroid 80  ie the oreo updatethis model has come up with so many problems1 call connectivity  i aint able to talk to someone on calls properly as it starts loosing the connectivity  or rather itll be like  im able to hear the person in talking to but the person on the other side isnt able to hear anything i say its got so bad that every time i call someone up they hang up saying bro im not able to hear u rn  ill call u back later 2 heating issues  you know whats the amazing part this cell phones gets heat up even when its not in use wooowwim tried of this heating issue  it gets to level where u cant  literally hold your cell3 hanging issues this cell has got me so crazy coz it hangs every now and then and lags performance they talk abt the high end processor in this cell i guess its just on paper stuff  and m not even able to use two app together  like instagram and whats app and if i switch to musically or snapchat  this cell just hates me then and goes black  i guess gotta talk to my cell abt it and settle it   ryt4 camera  i guess ill end up listing all the aspects of this cell  anyway camera in this cell phone is good  trust me on that  but it is when it wishes to be low light photographs are terribleit keeps on loosing focus  every timeit sometimes doesnt even start up  and then i have to reboot it5 video  picture quality  this cell phones video quality is too bad while u take it youll feel its good  but when u save it and seeits all noisy and full of glitchesas if i dont have sufficient net and m seeing a youtube video on 144 or 240 pixels6 battery life   okay ill stop on this point  coz honestly i never wrote such big reviews so  battery life of this cell is pathetic guys its so bad that it just lasts for 2 hrs 30 mins 80 in use i cant even carry it without a power bankcoz this cell looses its life so quickon the standby mode itself if i had an option of time and availability of cell phone as my cell is already dead  loosing 56 of its battery in 1hr 15mins  and all i was using is a fitness app  to attach few pictures of the section where battery usage is displayed  i forgot what its called  i wouldve shown u the standby usage  its first in my major usage list using 55 of lifebattery life is the major issue i face rn  coz i dont play games and  now i dont feel social sites that imp that they become my priority so when it gets heat up or lags  hangs i keep it aside and study or do somethin else  but calls and emergency texts or something imp need to be given priority ryt but this cell doesnt allow me to take it as its already displaying battery saver mode onsigh if youll did read this wholeeee thing  thanks nd im sorry i dont have the time to write down abt the good things in this cell phone  im sure youll find many other sources to find that out few good things are if u know how to use your frnd cell it takes amazing pictures in day light  i love taking pictures though and this cell is way better than most other cell phones out there its performance before the update was amazing and smooth i was able to switch between real quick  again better than most other phones and many other stuff so i rated it three coz its eventually lacking everything  but i love my cell phone üòÇi mean  ik this cell is really good its just the unstable updates that have ruined it

dont buy it until oreo patch is provided the oreo update as of 3 may 2018 made the experience of this mobile worst battery drains in 56 hours charging time 810 hrs wait till oreo patch that can help to stabilise the performance
amazing phone with affordable price headphone jack output sound quality is poor compare to the other models
why is the phone turns off on its ownsometimes during charging and sometimes anytime
nice
the 35 mm jack delivers so low sound the dolby atmos is useless coz of it the phones good but lenovo seriously needs to get killer notes software updates for headphone jack volume and its not the headset issue i am using a sound magic similar issues experienced by people using boat jbl üíÄ candy its all over lenovo forums but they arent paying no heed
worst mobile that i bought
phone performance is good but camera quality is not as 13mp also deft mode is worse 
excellent product
very nicepic quality must fine
it is a great phone one of the reasons which make this phone great is that there is a separate sd card slot
superbbb
up till now good phone but paid ‚Çπ1000 more as price dropped
killer phonebut amazon delivery is so poor
only one led color notification good camera amazing processor but heats up when 40mins of gaming but its okay in these price rangeoverall perfect product in these price range
awesome
good value for money phone but bad battery backupday to day usage is ok you would need to run for your charger every now and then plus heating you can cook an omelette occasionally
lenovo k5 is far better than k8

this is bad mobileautomatically mobile is offthis mobile is always hangso i suggest to dont buy this lenovo k8 note
this cell is very awesome its my personal experience those who are music lover its very awesome and also camera is superb cool totally its a value for money
i bought this as i wanted to get upgraded from mi note 3  my version was 3gb32gb this is a disappointment as i expected a robust device with helio and 4gb ram i didnt liked the stock android too may be i am used to miui version of androidcons 1 apps getting slow while using2 stock sms app is fail as it doesnt group notifications like miui does there is no copy otp option3 no screenshot button on the drag down menu from top4 battery isnt great although i am not a gaming enthupros1 only one  thats listening to music thru dolby atmos dont buy this if you are already using xoami  vivo  oppo  coolpad types this is a useless piece of mobile
at first i would like to thank amazon for taling back this product this mobile is an unmarked product with hitension issues or in other words its like expected a ton received a corn and again its not sweet corni would like to advise smart buyers that display over the screen and display after taking pics and videos recorded have a vast difference as many said that amazing crystal clear displaycamera fearures have given a tight slap to buyers and video recording has smacked every ones head down its like recording with 2 mp basic hand seti wish i can put more comments since i got my refund i am tight lipped nowwont be trusting lenovo here afteractually one should appreciate the video director for making all those random experiences that neither works nor respondsregret  regards

improve your hardware always screech
sound quality is not impressive in speaker mode volume is low poor bluetooth connectivity unable to use bluetooth paired in car as connectivity gets lost very frequently and is disturbing volume is low even when connected using aux cablerest of the performance is impressive
not working proprly in 1month itself
nice prodect

what is use of ur policies if customers hv to undergo tons of processes for resolution of problem launching an exclusive phonei purchase it and find defectsbut tech wll visit confirm thn replace but not return order and rrfund cause ur policy is lik tht horrendous experience of purchasing mobile phone online for the first tymlenovo k8 is very bad phoneheating issueshangs suddenlytouchscreen non responsive at timesthn had to switch off n on againtht too took a while to switch onall this only after a weeks useno problem wth amazon delivery
good phone
phone getting heatup
sir es order ko mene emi se purchase kiyakya meri emi complete ho gai
not good as it described in specifications poor camera quality in dual camera function not satisfied at all
heats up and low camera quality at dim light
there is no auto call recording option as in previous version there is no separate gallery double depth camera is not up to the level lots of improvement required
i really liked the sound quality of the device it‚Äôs a little heavier than i expected the dual camera usage is not as accurate as i thought it would be the depth is not very pronounced but it does give a good picture qualityoverall a good buy in its price range
as it is dolby atmos the speakers should be in upper n bottom like lenovo k4
front camera awsome back okgood performancebattery charging not that much fastertherebis no extra fetures like modified rom this is i dont likegood budget mobile really
nice
i highly recommend not to buy this lenovo let itslf down by not checking the phone before launching battery draining like hell bluetooth connectivity is a problem software has bugs not able to recieve calls sometyms i have to press power button twice to make screen work to recueve calls dual camera which lenovo says is a forte is not having enough features to even compete with other lower end single camera phones i am trapped not received the update yet and amazon will not take back the product once bought until u have physical damage
i like the material quality  picture quality
after orieo update phone is hanging a bit and charging is drain very quickly 
i loved this phone so much that i bought 3 one for me one for my mom and another one for my aunt the first two bought a month and two month back were made in china üòî and the one bought yesterday was only made in india so depressed and confused why the other two were made china üò¢should i raise a complaint against amazon or lenovo 
this is a great device at this price range camera quality is very good but depth mode is not so goodvery good user interfacemediatek x23 processor seems poweful
nice mobile delivery was on time
very ghtiya phone dont by itits betery issuedin me 3 baar charge krna pdta h yr net off me b bahut ghtiya phone dia h amazon neuper se camera quality ruff
nice product and good price sale
waste product battery does not come even 5hours
nice mobile phonebut already a lot of feature rich phones available in market in this price range
average model
not good there is much better option in this price range
gud phone battery backup is good and sound is also good if you listen music along with some good head phone it will be awesome
super
earphone not received
i would have happily given a 4 rating had it not been for the atrocious delivery quality of amazonpositives it has a premium look and feel and good build quality setting up was easy battery life is quite good with more than 1 day for my normal usage display quality is very good both front and rear cameras are reasonably good for the average user read negatives below split screen feature with two apps running at the same time is useful for people who really need it otherwise a novelty flash can be turned on in video recording which is another novelty with no significant improvement in video brightness except a drain on the batterynegatives lenovo claims turbocharging but with the standard microusb port and the charger provided charging is not very fast it took about 90 minutes to charge from 15 to full would hardly qualify as turbo the nougat os provided is stock android with very little customisation possibilities so may not be liked by users who are used to heavy uis on other phones  but once you get used to it you will start accepting it the bokeh effect with dual rear camera is just soso and many times the layer separation is not as precise as you expect it to be so you will not get desired results everytime also when you turn on the dual camera the front layer is also slightly out of focus on the whole you can forget that you have dual rear cameras and stick to single camera mode for peace of mind missing slowmotion and 4k recording are a shame panorama mode does not even cover 180 degreesoverall good value for money go for it if you want performance and not care for camera features
over all its a very good device but battery is some what
do not buy this product despite of good hardware configuration this mobile fail to provide basic features camera do not focus on particular object after tapping the much talked dual camera captures photo with very little blureness which looks too artificial as if edited in cheap photo editing software battery drains too quickly stock android is too much overloaded with google ads so even if ur mobile is screen locked video and other ads keep playing and generates sound brightness fail to lower its intensity in dark you can not cast the device screen on tv as it fails to detect the tv even from the video player you can not cast the screen this device do not provide that feature
i exchange my k5 note but i need now i will pay exchange amount
great phone
everything is fine  but battery backup is not so good notification light not working properly cant change the set ringtone manually

this phone as a whole comes with a lot of surprises and shocksphone hangs often and the second slim slot does not supportbattery last longer than other mobilesdual camera is very useful
it is really a good phone to buy touch is really smooth only the dual camera effects are not up to marks
i had purchased this product 10 days ago from amazonin this is what the problems i found on this purchase1 notification light doesnt work properly2 signal bar continously fluctuating up and down3battary drains very quickly like if game at 100 battery for 30 to 40 min it comes down to 6065 down even if u keep idle it still loses 89  battery from 1004 camera depth enabled option have issue in taking photos even front camera doesnt seems like its 13 maga pixal very poor5 heat up during browsing internetpls lenovo team look into this matter  cant believe phone is in sale with all this problem
very good product
good product but data cable not working
waste mobile
good mobile for the rate
very bad product i bought before 3 months hundred percent network issue very bad product no customer service solo my problem
bought in january so writing review after 5 months i got this phone for 11k in some offerat this price i think its quite worthy product1 camera quality is excellent but if youre comparing with dslr or other costly phone than you may be disappointed2 speed is fine unless you dont ask for lighting speed3 gaming  well i played both offline and online games its doing pretty well4 speaker and sounds both are doing well till datecons1 yup battery heats sometime but thats not the phone problem as i have noticed  its due to network fluctuations and sometimes if you talk while charging so you can go for it as its a budget phone im a moderate user of all the facilities
my honest review after using it for 6 months1 the processor is too worst booting of mobile takes 23 minutes and always shows an error message you cant even play small games like subway surfers without struck you can clearly see a lag in frames2 it doesnt have turbo charging it takes 1hr 20mins for a full charge mobiles with turbo charge will take 40mins it failed in this aspect also3 sometimes mobile will auto restart4 as a usual overheating problemin future i wont recommend lenovo for my friends
i hate this phone because of touch quality and camera  also os
overall performance is good but battery are not good and turbo chargeing is fake

worst phone i have ever seenpoor batteryvery slowly chargingslowly functioningheatingnetwork problemnot handy accesscustomer service is not goodi will share it on social networking sites to avoid common public harassment and cheating
worst phoneworst battery life drained in only 3 hours
i was waiting for a smartphone that can give all the features that any other product ain tgus price range would be able to give when i came across lenovo k8 note i was surprised with its features 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom was a cliche but a decacore processor was the best thing to have in a smartphone in this price range overall performance is awesome
dont buy it cast option doesnt work in lenovo
i love this phnthats what i really wantcamera quality battery display quality voice quality everything is perfecthappy with this phnüòÄ
this phone is full paisa wasol phone because in this range i dont see any phone like this i like its sound quality and camera and more good features like vr spilt dislpay or dolby atom etc but i disappointed by its heating problem some time it become very hot if we continuously use it for one hour but battery life is good according to me it is a good phone
invoice
dont deserve a star also
legit product  but my earphones arent fitting properly in the audio jack  although it gives audio feedback correctly not sure if this is a lenovo thing or a manufacturing defect
very very good quality
overall good product have been using from one month and i think except rear camera and battery backup everything is fine working at this time
nice phone overallbut do not have camera 13mp as expected and sometime have heating problem
speaker was tear within 4 months not so good
raju
sound is not as desired only one speaker outlet at bottom works
battery performance is not upto the mark considering its 4000 mah battery otherwise a good mobile in this price range 
awesome 1
mobile it is good
truly i dont find any cons in this phone 64gb helps a lot in installing apps which will stay in phone memory good ram that i can see the apps still stand even if i open it on the next day camera is amazing depth mode is good selfie is bad the picture quality is not good very bad when front flash is on battery backup is very good turbo charging working very well
bkwas product 2 din me rula k patak dia isne network not work properly when anybody call me then its show them out of coverage wat the hell wifi hotspot error because a lenovo laptop dont connect with lenovo product so hillariousamazon service is very good and i thnkful for amazon custmer service for replacement
the mobile doesnt have auto call record feature which is normally found in todays feature phones
booked it on may 04 2018  as usual amazon delivered it by time here comes the problem just after 10 days the low quality stuff used in this mobile like mother board and processor start troubling me like anything it used to get switch off with loud noise and disturbed display more over heating issue even my iron box doesnt heat up that much i visited the lenovo store near me they stated that this is happening because of new update their version is unsatisfactory  i thought i got a faulty one but once i was in to the store then i came to know that almost 9 out of 10 are faulty ones and every customer of lenovomoto mourning out in the customer care centers

too good a phone for sub rs 15 k fingerprint sensor is very fast very good camera very clear music system when headgear used battery is efficient for my use it lasts for 2 days no negatives except that one has to get used to its latest software to play with it overall design is quite impressive
value for money updates are not easy and regular as they claim
good phone

killer note but it is only killing me frustrated and highly disappointed i am writing this after 2 month usage nothing great to tell about the phone just an another note serious from lenova the specification looks great on paper and in reality everything sucksit gets heated up even for normal usage the battery drains faster than normal mobiles it is not a 4000mah battery for surethe camera looks good not better dont zoom it while taking long shots th picture quality is not up to the markit does not behave like 4gb ram it rather responds like 2gb ram and gets jammed frequentlyi have installed many apps and after getting the phone slowed down i have removed most of the apsguys the price was reduced but still you shall go for a better brands like moto mi samsung
the phone is good but camera is not up to mark for photo loving guys

battery drain so quickly after updating battery back up is low
cool phone except for battery draining issuerest is fine
good phone
poor battery
worst
just like a labour class product
after one month of use with k8 its good phone in this range mean while i would like to share some negative sides compare to samsung j7 battery backup is not so gud  even sumsung has only 3000 mah its backup is better than k8 4000 mah screenshot facility is available in power button but we have to change the option from settings musik key camera is fine and hd quality but we cant blur the baground images as like lenovo vibe s1due to curved screen tempered glass will not fix properly
its a totally dummy fake phones and cheating with the customer
simply amazing
i am not sure why people are writing bad reviews but my take is value for money
best mobile at this range
camera is not upto the mark
weight more but other future are good
everything is nice but back camera is very very bad
bkvas
the phone i received looked like a refurbished one its not x23 chipset but x20 which is an older variant camera quality is not at all good cpu runs at 40 to 50 percent even when kept in idle mode ram optimization is not there so you will get less free ram for your usage god knows why anyway the technical department agreed to refund the money
good phone at a low budget

it has been 3 months i had bought the product now since last couple of days battery drains out in 68 hours of normal usage earlier it used to work more than 14 hoursfurther once the battery level reaches 25 the phone starts heating up and draining the batteries further fastphone does not get charged by any other charger except supplied by lenovoi suggest not to buy this product various other options are available in the market at this price or better price
wrost product wasted my money wanted to return but unable to do so wrorst experience with amozon
super product with great performance
good phone
good one but getting hot while using net for long time
i have done order with the nocoast emi but bank taking regularly rate of interest on amount also i am unable to connect your telephonic executive
overall its an ok device i gave it to a friend and he complaint about heating and charging issues at first but now after reformatting it it is going on quite good so it can be called as a decent device and these kind of issues usually occur when the phones are sold via sales so good phone afterall
nice product for this cost
nice phone good picture quality n also good battery im using from 3 months there is no problem with this phoneüòá but one camera at back wont work its not dual camera
super pathetic devicei have used multiple phones of lenovothis is one of the worst in terms of performance never expected this i used to be a huge fan of lenovo phonesthis time they have drastically embarrassed me i spoke to amazon rep and they checked the temperature which was 45 degree celsius and per the rep it was normal someone tell them 45 is overheating and the irony is you are stuck with this device you cannot ask for refund its a cheating and government should do something about it everything is bad right from performance to camera to heating to hardware
poor service form lenova after the purchased
super config phone within 12k budget working well so far 
phone is good camera quality is also goodit works better than samsung or mi phones but the only problem i faced is with the batteryinspite of having 4000mah battery its hardly last for 14 hours i am using jio lte simand with ds it only last for 1415 hoursif you use internet the battery drains so fast 35of battery drains within 2 hour
battery drain problem
bad
while charging over heating
awesome
good looking phone best
nothing wrong upto now its a nice product from lenovo cameras are quite good regarding speed its faster than others of this kindbut the only thing is that there is no idea about the second rear camera how it worksafter all its very good till now
killer phone from lenovo delivery was good and performance was excellent only bad thing is secondary camera and slow motion 4k recording capability was not there
build quality and pure andriod experience is very good battery backup is ok ok but main issue i faced is network fluctuation on the phone every second changing to 2g 3g  4g even in well covered areacall quality was poor hence returned and got refunded

nice and genuine product
fantastic
screen cast does not work and when complained to lenovo suggested to buy a chrome cast and use the screen cast which i suggest to add a patch in android make it work directly as i was happy to use lenovo k5 note and its screen castalso i do not see any significant change in 400 ah battery vs 3500 mah battery in k5 note suggest for improving the sametorch light is natural which is yellowish in nature is the led designed such way or is their any issue as same light appears whiter when it works as flash while taking a photo
best phone and operating system too good
too poor camera quality as lenovo committed that 135 mp rear camera while zoom on 1x level image quality will be getting worst according to tap on little bit zoomso poor quality as well as after taking snaps pixel quality also worst on zooming imagei ruined my 14 k bucks on this nonsense thing
camera quality excellentheating problem starts if using back coverback cover needs to remove to avoid heating problem
nice

nice mobile i am a big fan of lenovo good processor great memory even style is good
camer  both excellentprocesser  nicebut only problem is battery slightly warm after 1  2 hrs used n its stand by 1 day
worst product from lenovo till date the hand set has issues from the date of purchase issues faced are as under and can be an eye opener for the prospective buyers1 hangup during usage  very often you are left stranded in between apps as phone hangsup in between usage like checking whatsapp email of sms2 heats up excessively  the claim of fast charging is false it takes almost 5 hours for full charge heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast the battery doesnt last even 5 hours post full charge3 battery  the claim on turbo charge is false there is no fast charging and it takes 56 hours for full charge heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast the battery doesnt last even 5 hours post full charge4 access to common functions  doesnt even have access to common functions like providing sms service centre number have recently taken the handset to a lenovo service centre even they didnt know how to put in the sms service centre number5 lenovo forum  unlike other leading or even lesser known brands lenovo executives dont respond to the queriesissues put up on the forumover all very bad product to choose my issue how to dispose the sameregardscertified buyer
vrygood
doesnt fit lenovo k8 note
awesome phonemust buy
i did not receive head phone in box  headphones accessory is missing and camera clarity of this phone is pethetic
the phone display got damaged within 7 months of usage and the service center has declined the warranty stating there is an internal damage to the display i asked them to open the phone and show the internal damage to that i can accept their statement for which they are not ready they say even if they open they cant show the damage even after escalating the issue the issue is not resolved and they are not ready to honor the warranty better to go for accidental damage coverage if you are going with this phone
camera achaa hai processer achaa hai bs kmi battry me hai ekdm bekar chalti hai
i m not happy with lenevo not k8 i want to return this product please help amazon
guys this phone is superior in hardware buylt its software has major shortcomings lenovo k3k4 users should not buy this phone considering the performance of those phones the software part misses some functions which makes it an below average phone for day to day use cons phones design is rectangular so it does not fits perfectly in hand and feels heavier no option to save contacts in phone memory  only gmail ac contacts support which makes contacts and call logs and messages laggy it lags wherever you require to get contact from contacts their is no option to disable vibration on call connect its mono loud speakers sound is loud but quality is like cheap chinese phone its not like k3  k4 notepros good battery backup  4 star for it screen resolution colors  touch screen is very smooth  5star for them good processor works faster and better but phones seems laggy due to poor hardware software coordinationi will not recomend to buy this phone instead go for samsung phones as their software is always balanced
nice phone  battery backup is also good as well as speaker but the camera is not that much better in single mode its betterbut in duel or depth mode its badbut the performance of the phone is outstandingno issue with heavy gaminga good phone for gaming and soundno issue after update
very bed
very poor productits take 5 to 6 hours to chargeand discharge so fastits also hitting problemone camera out of dual frant camera also not workingits looking like dummy cameragorilla galss also so poor its break easily

battery charges very latewhile charging it heat upmy friend got the same product but the product was defective when they ordered for replacement till now they r not replied
good display upon unlocking the screen does not respond sometimes contacts can not be saved saved names get lost after some time and you see only the no i doubt batt is 4000 mah buy considering this
big warning never ever buy this product amazon was great in delivering the product in great packaging and it was an original product when i bought it in sept 17 but after using for months i just regret buying it battery does not last for more than 56 hours keeps on hanging and takes a lot time in saving pics being 64 gb and decacore it was supposed too run smoothly but its a waste piece my sony m2 phone was much better than this even after using for four years runs perfectly never buy lenovo phones

absolutely horrendous battery life the phone is good and works well but the battery runs out in no time and to make things worse the phone doesnt charge fast for some reason so it takes hours for the phone to get charged not expected from lenovo have been using their devices for a long time and never had a problem earlier but this product is pathetic
not a value for money as it does not support voltecamera quality is really bad when compare to lenova k4 note vibei brought lenova k8 note based on expectation lenova k4 note vibe that it will be more better than lenova k4 note vibebut lenova k8 note is worst than all lenova seriesnot at a value for money

good phone bad camera great performanceim not one to write lengthy reviews of products but here i felt the need to get a few points out there because the lenovo k8 note isnt all that it promises to be but its definitely not an average product eitherpoint is i bought this phone to replace my redmi note 3 3gb and 32gb i have an s7 edge as my primary driver ive always kept a second phone to game and watch videos the other options i had considered were the honor 6x and the honor 8 lite the reason i went with lenovo k8 note was for the dual camera setup and a good industry reviews on performance it wouldnt hurt that my backup phone had a dual camera setup to play around with some bokeh fun heres my thoughts after using the phone as my primary phone for the past 3 daysperformancethis phone is everything that every review claims it to be yes it has a mediatek processor but this decacore setup with 4gb ram and 64gb memory is phenomenal in my experience this phone handles multitasking as good as my s7 edge i was playing guns of boom wwe champions youtube video and facebook all at the same time and over a period of 45 minutes the phone switched between these apps without a single glitch or delay wwe champions was open when i locked my phone when i picked it back up afetr 20 odd minutes i found the screen exactly where i left and it loaded the game without a seconds delay if you want this phone for casual gaming and media its just a pleasure to usecamerain all fairness the dual camera setup on the k8 note requires a lot of polishing its nowhere near as good as the honor 6x the depth detection feature is very erratic it works like a charm under good and day light but try using it indoors and in the evening youll either be left with hazy photos lacking sharpness or pictures that have been focused in the wrong areas the front 13 mp camera is good for casual selfies thoughone thing though put the flash on and both the front and the back cameras return stellar results the bokeh effects and the depth editor functions may not work as well as they should but if you manage to keep a steady hand and get a good shot from the dual camera setup then playing around with the options can be fun changing background and focus are fun options check photosbattery ui build and valuethe battery backup is great to say the least i tested it by playing a graphic intensive modern combat 5 for 25 hours straight and the battery dropped from 100 to 50 the casual day with some gaming social media and calling etc takes the phone to 3020 per cent max by 12 in the nightthe phone comes with a clear  transparent plastic case installed on the phone since there arent any good choices for a k8 note cover this preinstalled one serves the purpose but it is scratch prone just the second day it had dozens of scratches check the photothe all metallic build of the phone looks and feel very premium the black colour has a nice matte finish too but the back love fingerprints and gets a smudge very easily check photo its best to use a black armour  cover when they become availablethe best part of the k8 note is the stock android ui that ensures the k8 note is smooth and perfectly functional its a snappy phone alright the finger print sensor works like a charm on both hands it picks up even the most obscure touchesfinal wordi would definitely recommended the k8 note in terms of sheer performance this phone is a pleasure its like a tuned up ktm engine it may not have the most appeasing specs but the performance is all throttle and torque friendly sadly the camera is below average to be frank either lenovo push through some tuneups or the buyers will have to keep their photography ambitions under a strict check
not bad battery not working as 4000mah camera bad working like 2mp need update depth mode

second peas
your product was faulty and i asked for replace u r just engaging me in rubish things   do this then do that   at last nothing happened
good phone in all respects  but slightly sluggish camera autofocus 
really good phone other than the dual camera software
i am using this for quite some time now so thought of reviewing iteverything is as per specifications given so i am not wasting ur time writing all those again lets gets straight to the pros and consadv1 processor works fast so there is less chance of the pg one to get hanged2 battery backup is quite large as it has 4000mah battery3 front cam is ok4charging is super fast i must saybut with time after a few years this speed will gradually decrease thats the problem with lenovo phones5 overall its okdisadvantages1 the back camera quality is not as it has been advertisedi would say it gives clear images ofcourse but it takes a long time to focus and adjusti mean pretty long time to get ur perfect image which u desire2 even though it has a 4000 mah battery still i dont find any difference with the 30003500 mah batterysthe discharge is samei think by now u hv got the idea that its a ok type phone not greati am also using lenovo vibe k5 note for a year nowall the configerations r same just the battery is a 3500mah one and it has a single back camera thats itso i would say lenovo vibe k5 note is far better than thisatleast i felt it in these couple of monthsu can give it a try after all u always hv the option of returning on amazonso all the bestif u found my review helpful dont forget to give a like thankssss and happy shopping
is bad product net using time very high heating
excellent
its balanced phn in all featuresthe main thing is the helio x23 processor is too better than snapdragon 625 and also battery efficientcamera is giving best results its the best choice
nice mobile bay mobile
worst experience ever with amazon bcoz of lenovo who degrade amazon valuation gives me defective peice
good phone at the price its being offered not a great camera and display but has a good ram and storage dedicated sd card slot is a big plus not many phones offer this now camera image quality is below average but good at this price pointreal value for money
battery performance is poor after using 10 day it has changing problem takes 5 to 6 hours to full charge 
very bad in catching signalalways says out of range
feature is good but only one speaker worksno gallery in the phone
this phone worked well in india but did not work in us att and tmobile frequencies do not match att is did not work at all with tmobile only voice works should not have bought this phone
its a good phone but there are some issues with the camera the camera cannot adjust the exposer so the image are more whitish and not real i hope this will be fixed via a system update but if want a perfect mobile with everything balance and your budget is 15k then u can take mi a1subscribe my youtube channel named asdc technical
its was great your product but now im to able to contact with u for my complian gst detail update on my invoice copyi had two times contact coustermer care no one person can give positive feedback about
the mobile has some good features but charging is very slow nearly 4 hours initially there were problems with volte jio connectivity jio was good for internet but calls and messaging did not work on this handset the same jio sim worked well in another 4g handset with software update this issue the camera doesnt start sometimes and i had to restart the mobile restarting this mobile also takes a long time compared to other mobiles lenovo has to seriously fix these issues
my experience with this phone has been mixed the good thing about the phone is the 1080p resolution the videos look crisp so you can watch youtube  netflix  prime and enjoy the visualsthe sound is not loud enough even adding a headphone does not help much unless it has an amplifier you will have problems while receiving calls because the incoming volume is low i called up the customer case and they asked me to do a factory reset did not helpthe touch screen gets laggy after some timei have enough spare storage and even when no apps are running i can feel the lag another irritation is while holding the phone the touchscreen gets touched and results in unintentional clicks
i have purchased lennovo k8 but the mobile not switched on but heatthere is no response our complaintcustmore care is not respondingfeed back immediately
very good product
really happy with this productcan any guide to cast screen
very good phone having very good camera  battery back up is good  and no heating issues
not worth for buying lack many key features which was their in k5 or 6 note also mobile heats like an oven even if used for 1 hour and battery backup is pathetic
very bad phone from lenovo battery draining fastly and mobile heat up even of 5 min normal gaming network never shows full and shows no signal after some timecamera deapth mode is not so good as mentioned by the lenovocomplete wastage of money
worst camera quality for both front  back
not satisfied with the product fast charging in just 90 minutes only
do not buy this productin just 6 months i had to pay rs 2000 for servicingbattery drains faster than it gets chargeddoes not even provide adequate standby time 20  25  battery gets drained overnight and the phone just gets switched off even when no background application is running and the network is off no autobrightness option 55  60 ram is always occupied no matter whatever i do to clear it and the phone lags even in simple games like subway surferswith all the features advertised and at this price range it is frustrating
worth it aug 2017 best config on this date for this price
the battery performance of the mobile is like 2500mah capacity screen on time is just average 4hrs rear camera is good and selfie camera tooo good performance is excellent dolby atmos is average
nothing in particular
such a waste of moneydont buy this handset im trying to return this
worst mobile i suggest pls go for other mobilestwo major issue 1 heats up and 2 battery drain fast
getting very heat battery getting very weak within 10 hours with out using data connet
good camera decent battery life selfie camera great biggest problem is sms send failure you cant recognize ur device so online banking impossible already inform lenovo lets hope it will be solved asap
cash back not credited for this purchase yet product is good
in this mobile the gorilla glass is duplicate after some time use purchase date 24012018 glass is broken on corner side
liked the product amazing features seamless performance good build quality and most important reasonably priced
best phone i have ever had
lenovo k8 having turbo chargingbut it works automatically sometime it‚Äôs charge in 125 hrs and sometime it take more than 2 hrsheavy weight of 180 grmperformance of rear camera is not too much good in low light conditions and rear camera performance also one problem sometime you will see blurred images no subject is in focusand one main disadvateage is battery is draining fast cannot use one day full  bettery choise is any other phone very bad

not satisfied with its performancehanging is the big disadvantage of this phone
phone is very good but data cable is very bad quality
network not good sim is not working properlymobile have no eye protectionwithout eye protection screen light is bad for eye

osm mobile
4deducted due tovvery poor battery performance drains in 25hrs only
got the device yesterdayfrom first charge itself the charger makes loud hissing noise continuously during charging this device but no noise while charging other devices similarly no noise comes when charged this device using another charger now im using the old lenovo charger instead of the new one2 many software issues dolby atmos is not workingclock is not getting updated while on callsometimes native app itself opens twice
camera result is not more expected that i thought
lenovo k8 note does not seem to support screen cast you can cast you tube videos but you cant cast amazon prime videos the device or the os seems to have a bug and does not recognize my smart tv when i try to cast i checked online for solutions and lenovo says to use chromecast thus asking us to buy that indirectly dont buy this phone also it is not taking screenshot even though i tried the steps they have written also it doesnt recognize my ear phones which works perfectly with other lenovo phones faulty device dont buy
this product is good for use and features are satisfing according to price
overall good phone
early warm up and slow down
phone is very nice but packing is very third class when i open tha box my phone and back cover have some scratches feeling bad for it
best value for money lovely design and form factor with good configuration bought it for my father in law he is very much satisfied go ahead and buy it
worst phone i changed it with mi a1bad camerabad youtubebad gpu  i thought it would be good but nope
very poor battery back upjust rubbish
if you are thinking or considering this phone i simply say buy it best for the prize u hardly find and difference between this and moto g5splus yes very minor issues but literally you hardly notice them or use them buy it to save money using this from three months im halpy with it
this product has battery problemit is draining too much battery in few minutes
battery is draining very poor after 30 battery mobile will switch off immediately
its battery life is very poor and jio network also not come properly
it is not possible to put both the 4g sim cards at a time
everything is great in this phone but problem in doing casting as it does not support screen mirroring but for casting you need a same wifi network which is connected to your phone and with your smart led tv
battery performance is not up to the mark
weight toda jada phone ka
very very good phoneno heating issue long lasting batterygaming is as smooth as butterno lagsound quality is aswomescreen quality is really goodcall quality is also goodamazon is the best
as im a business man this mobile is very useful because its battery charge lasts for longer hours

living up to my expectations
device remains hot even when kept in the pocket it keeps heating up big battery issue as bettery last long for 15 hours max without any heavy usage no turbo charging as mentioined in thw ad it take around 4 hours for full charge be careful
the device was poor quality product by lenovo
this phone is good but sometimes when i open gallery the screen of my phone is suddenly turn into white blank screen and there is only one way to get out of this situationis to press your power button turn of your screen then start your phone againthe camera of this phone is averageotherwise battery was awesome
very good
horrible experience had to return on the same day very bad phone promised technician vist never came keep away from this phone it does not have emi dedicated volte built in currently gold standard for any phone these days

our mobile is mistec
phone gets too much heat even if you do not use internet or play videoseven u cant hold it in your hands as the device gets too warm and now i should go to lenovo service center as the phone is taking 5 hrs to fully charge and no battery backup worst phone my hands are becoming so warm by holding this stupid phone guys please dont buy this phone dont encourage lenovo and amazon shame on u for selling this fraudulent phones
this phone is very bad  not sport well jio network and not work fast charging and very hitting problem not buy this phone

its superb
cant set preferred ring tones from sd card or others only a few inbuilt ring tones can be used
mobile is ok but service by amazon team very poor so i plan close my amazon account and going for some other ecommerce site
do not buy it its charger will start creating problem very soon and phone too have not good battery back up as mentioned its voice starting to get low within two months of use worst of sprnding such amount
my opinion after using phone  pros turbo feature 4000 mah battry 13 mp camera  dual camera setup fingerprint is too fast  processor is very very fast cons battry backup is bad  rear camera is too bad and weight is too heavy  in 64 gb storage u will get only 50gb which is so bad 
speaker is useless 
actually i love lenovoi have used k5note and impressed but ki note is not up to the mark
excellent phone all premium features at an affordable price i got it in just over 9k in amazon sale üòé

best phone in sub 15 k category
good producteverything is perfect in this phone when compared with its price
its nice onebut software futures need to add more options
have been using k4 note for over an year  half very satisfied with that k8 with nougat os is marginally better on overall performance but seriously low on user customization audio level of speaker and headphone a big letdown
awesome
stay away from this phone signal quality is not just bad  it is a fail kseries finally has brought in the disease that finished motorola k8 note says on the back that it is made by moto mobility i have had 3 k3 notes 2 k4 notes  1 k5 note all good phones k4 note is an excellent phone this k8 note is crap i will have to throw it away it is completely unpredictable with signal reception strong 3g signal with no data strong 4g signal and then another minute zero signal strong signal but bad call quality i can go on  on it is a very inconvenient user experience so kseries legacy has been done with motorolas legacy of oblivion
a good device in this budget with these specifications
can look for other options in this price range

worst product
its a amazing phone with good performance nice look and great value of money  just need a support from amazon to help me for pic replacement as this device takes lot time of charging and drain so fast  i know its some fault with mine device or else phone is awsome
after 7 months of purchase i updated the software which was recommended by lenovo the moment after updating the next version of software the battery life came to 4 hrs also mobile is getting very hot i am completely disappointed
4g connectivity not working network is up down not connect properly call drop nd disconnect internet plz refund my money
automatic call recordings not coming in this mobile
lenovo k8 note is a worst mobile with low sound and camera quality dont buy these amazon peoples will not support for returnsimply they used to mention it can be returned within 10 days but no meaning in that

outstanding great battery excellent camera awesome performance
i will never recommend to purchase to lenovo mobile i am very flustered about lenovo product and services because i purchased four device of lenovo k8 note and all are failed during one month one goes battery failed second phone‚Äôs speaker failed third phone sensor stopped to work and forth one mic problem this is first time when i took decision to go out from apple samsung and htc but now seems it was very bad idea to choose other from them lenovo failing to provide good device as well service too they don‚Äôt keep any hardware device in advance they always order new for new complain and give time line upto 3 days but they won‚Äôt give you in three days it will take almost one and half week to resolve issue they don‚Äôt have good product and good service
not for music lovers

bad phone
battery life is very poor quality and camera clarity is very good
awesome phone thanks
pathetic battery bad camera problem in bluetooth heating issuevery poor product
the charging is not fast and has a lot of heating problem the new product will work good for few days but after rough usage it takes 45 hrs for full charging
everything in this particular android is working great i am using it from last 45 months the only issue that i am having is with the so called scratch resistant or you can say scratch proof gorilla glass its getting scratches even when put in the pocket of a loose formal trousers as well i must say there is 0 rating for the lenovo k8 notes screen
never ever buy a lenovo phone in your life these phones are good just for few months after that they start showing their true colors games lag a loteven games like subway surfer please go for a redmi if are looking for a phone to play games meditek sucks
thank you for this amazing phone functions is very good best phone ever

i am using it for the last two weeks dont buy this one mobile keeps restarting itself again and again
bluetooth done not work properly with bluetooth speaker music breaks when you play thru youtube or google or any music apps

overall good phone with good display and good performance price is perfect it has 10 cores which runs fine sound is very good speed is okay looks value for money camera quality is not too great and also images with dual camera depth looks somewhat like software depth rather than hardware depth from dual cameras overall picture quality is okay earphone should have been part of set

cell phone is awesome some camera drawback but motherboard is producing some kind of problem like hanging and battery draining and timing problem the clock is not showing the proper timing but ultimately phone is awesome i would definitely read it 5 star but due to this problem i am writing it 3 star and i know the problem is the processor that is mediatek which drinks a lot of battery and im not a stable processor
device is getting over heated and battery is draining fast
1i must say if you are a k4 user then k8 music will just disappoint you2 the camera performance will break your heart really 3 battery backup is not good as 4000mahif you buy this phone for music battery and camera please dont buy this phone

if we compare with redmi minote 4 the battery backup  processing speed is very poor
heating problem is too much
worst phone takes 2days to charge full battery and heats up like iron box could not replace the phone bcoz amazon tech team says the phone is normal and direct me to lenovo service which is a waste of my time on a brand new phone and now im stuck with this heavy brick of electronic crap not worth even a star very disappointed with unlimited problems
not at all happy with camerafront camera is 13 mp but very bad quality video and picturesplease dont buy those who are looking for good picture
great phone except for one irritant processors heat up when playing high graphics oriented games like war robots and lags to keep upelse its a workhorse with great battery
phone is slimgood battery backup and camera quality is nice satisfied with its performance
please avoid this amazon certified product got mobile from amazon within 8 days it got crack in glass while keeping in pocket in original product they have mention as gorilla glass but it cracked simply it must be fake am really worried totally unsatisfied with amazon nowi face similer issue before in you tube they tested the mobile with heavy tools its working without simple scratch hear after i never buy anything in amazon customer support they have well training to handle the customer without worry about customer query simply they make us believe it all user fault oh god its really painful

a good one from lenovo but have some heating issue while gaming on my device both front and rear cameras are good but the depth mode camera is ok also i am little confused about lte or volte ad i am not using jio but worth buying as a budget phone

awesome product
hellothe phone starts resetting itself randomly this issue starts after after 3 days of use especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is preinstalledi am feeling like a stupid for having done this  after that for 4 or 5 days it didnt show this issue now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night use the phone in night then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning boom it is dead already and when you manually poweron there is enough juice left in the battery not sure what to do with this kind of issue the phone is absolutely uselesswhen i approached amazon for return they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified not sure even it is rectifiable issue the below amazons tagline tagline sounds funny earths most customercentric company i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage
its amazingsuperb sound awesome camera its a complete package
awesome product
nice product
turbo charging stopped working with the in  box charger 10days after buyingfirst gave 4 stars to thisbut now i would have given 0 star if it existedi wouldnt have bought the phone if it wasnt for turbo chargernot only thisthere are still many conslike cast option doesnt work but this is a major problemand the service is worstthe charger didnt work for the second time and the service centre wierdos lied that the warranty period for the charger is over and asked to pay rs 1500 for the new oneand know what the charger still has 6 months warranty left selling phones by making false statementslenovo sucks
i bought this phone with lot of hopes going by the specs described however it was a huge disappointmentbig mistake the phone is absolutely rubbishblue tooth was not working volume and sound output was very poor considering that lenovo claims those are dolby stereo camera was not upto the mark display was not abysmal colour display was nothing to write home aboutall in all it is one helluva disaster of a phonein summary please dont buyits not worth the moneyi wouldnt pay even 5000k for this
the phone is overall gud but has no battery backup and the phone is heatingbetter on camera in normal modehas great aminities but it has to fix many problems
phone is heating like hell even on little use not recommended at all

very worst experience got used one product with missing manual looks like product was second buy
sound is very low with any earphone and head phone
the phone is ok nothing really extraordinary about it in fact the battery life is not as good as they claim mine does not last a daydespite the fact that i am not watching any videos or playing video games
i am facing problem of dual sim network in this phone usually the sim 1 works fine but sim 2 doesntget the network i interchanged the sim position but the problem countiued both sim work perfectly fine in other mobilesi got the mobile replaced but same problem with other handsetanother thing i noticed is that despite of killer specifications phone is lagging a little bit in simple tasks like opening photos etcit takes time to focus on displayed photos in galleryi didnt even downloaded any games its really surprising i was initiallyvery excited about this mobile but i found it over rated nowmoreover i guess with the passage of time unfortunately the quality of goods at amazon is deteriorating day by day i have been a loyal customer of amazon from so many years but now i think i should look for other optionsreally disappointed this time
its literally cheating the people with wrong information on long lasting battery  turbo charging feature as both features are not as per the specifications
its a good phone but dont know how to handal dual rear cam 
camera worsted lenovo china phone duplicate phone earphones no camera 3 mega bad
worst experience with amazon first time given worst mobile fraction of seconds battery drained even next time also phone hanging a lot

its a amazing phone thanks to amazon
good fonegood camerabut charging takes a lot of timend need some software updates my old k3note is better and faster than this k8 note
writing this review after using this mobile for one weekfast delivery by amazon and packaging is goodphone is some what heavy but still manageable when i switched on internet it asked for some system updates before those updates i didnt face much issue with the mobile but after that update if u charged ur mobile once it reached 100 automatically phone will be switched off so we cant charge it in the night and have to unplug it before its reaching 100battery backup is ok will last for one day if you didnt play much games you cant cover the screen entirely by using tempered glass because of edge design charging is taking much time eventhough its saying it has quick charge option earphone is missing in the box camera clarity is average they have opted so many moto technologies but still needs to improve a lotandroid 80 update will be received on july as per lenovo i believe with in that they will launch the next version

updated reviewi had used redmi 4a before  never had any network issue with vodafone but with this phone im constantly switching from 3g to g to 3g depending on the areabattery is draining fast unless you charge it to full for over 3 hrscan someone recommend where to buy the orginal fast charger for this mine got damaged in the rainso i have only been using it for less than 24hrs but heres what all i discoveredcons1 heating issue exists while i spent time trying to figure out this depth mode my cam was on for around 15 20 min with wifi running in the background the phone started getting warmer in my hand to the point that you could just almost be uncomfortable2 slippery back coveralthough the phone comes with a transparent hard back cover its still a bit slippery the original cover is like a magnet for patches  sweaty hands do no good to it3 batterywhen i unboxed the phonearound 6pm it had some 46 charge already which however lasted only until 12am 6hours with no gaming or media usage surprisingly when the battery alarm went off at 15 it lasted for just 10 min before shutting down if 15 charge with low battery mode activated gives me just 10 min thats really pathetic id say with my redmi 4a i used to survive at least an hour with 15 charge very disappointed4 network issues i used vodafone 4g while mobile data lacked any disruptions in connection what i found is low voice quality even in open spaces there was loss of voice  the bars for network werent fullpros1 the dolby atomos speakers 45 would need to figure out how to control the bass etc speakers are quite loud though havent yet checked with the ringer volume when phone is in pocket2 front camagain excellent i especially love the flash which doest give you an ashen look but colour stays vibrant3 depth mode the bokeh mode does take about 1015 min of practice to figure out the after effects like removing background  selective monochrome are great4 no lags yet im yet to install any games but after opening around 56 social media apps  te phone didnt show any lags5 display with the adaptive brightness on is a treat no more squinting in the sun to make out whats on the screen also when i played videos the clarity was brilliant cant wait to try the vr mode6 split screen feature is quite convenient i used with whatsapp  chromewill update more after a few days of use especially about the battery which is the main reason i bought this phone
very good
i have purchased this product before 2 weeksüîàspeaker performance is 0 out of 5 as compared to k4 noteit is quiet disapoainted me that it doesnt support dolby atmos but company is saying it is dolby atmoscamera is out of focustotaly worst as compared to other dual cam phonesbattery back up is 1 dayonly plus is heavy speed in browsing andhd pictures screen quality is average1 out of 5üò¢üò¢üò¢do not buy this modelbetter u go for k4 or k3
i am so much loving this phone its amazing i think its best phone
everything is best
camera quality is amazing
the moment i installed oreo 80 on 02may it started heating up  now battery is giving up in 45 hrs i have purchased it on 09 oct2017
battery heating issue  battery drains  its taking 14 to 15 hrs to charge full phone and within 2 hrs battery is 0 most off time does not even charge  service center people are also not responding they also dont know what to do they r saying its because of system update  i am using lenovo 1st tym hope this issue will get resolved otherwise i will never recommend this brand to anyonevery upset
good but one only speaker workingbut now all other phones better it
i liked the product andit is delivered on time
this product not goodwhy means over hetingi want another company phone
dont buy this product
i dont know why some people have given 5 or 4 star rating to this crap this phone has serious issues regarding everything the dual camera setup is something like jugaad of dslr quality photography i didnt find any serious performance issues as it is mediateknot snapdragon i expect nothing great from mediatek the biggest drawback is the screen quality i was watching a video on youtube suddenly i thought i should increase the resolution to check the quality of screen dudeit was already playing on 1080p screen just doesnt feels like full hd ie 1080p not even close to 720p dolby audio is nothing but just a fake software vr works like charm fingerprint is good responsive didnt find issues with call quality or wifi reception build quality is strictly average due to just fine metallic body phone will get heated up if you play games or watch video backlit navigation bar is not therethat means during nightyou will probably end us guessing the navs front camera is again okselfie flash just another light feature on image turbo charging is again not so impressive earphone jack is not of standard size or configuration as ejecting or inserting is little hard overall average phonei am waiting for the customer care call to return this phone hugely disappointed

great experience with tis amazing product from lenovoit is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone requireddeca core processor long lasting battery and 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesomei would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers
i have connect the phone via sony blue tooth video getting hang while watching video in youtube or any other app i dont understand the prob  while connecting the same bluetooth to other phone it work properlythe prob is only with video audio and voice call work properlypls suggest the solution 
poor signal reception
good but heating issue
nice phone pleased to have it thanks amazon for delivering it
my lenovo k8 note left side speaker not working
very poor is lenovo k8note
no star  ist time m disappointed from amazon service
cameras not as expected not able to take good pics as compared to latest iphone models the dual mode is not much as expected especially outdoors it needs to be worked on its ok for a normal user but quality is why people buy a camera phone especially a photography lover like me i give the camera including the dual mode a 6510powerful performance no doubt we can enjoy using heavy apps without any problems 64 gb internal memory is enough for me 810light weight body easy to handle good android software panels should have been backlit you have to search them in dark üòû 710
its nice smartphone smart features and awesome to uses the camera quality is nice mostly battery backup is fantastic you must purchase from amazon amazon give very cheap price
got the same phone from flipkart at 8540 plus they have given me 10 discount on hdfc card
 no option of sms sending for both sim you have to select one default no option of ask for sim led notification light not working no option to stop vibration when other end user pick up the phone  battery is drain very fast in mediateck processor not showing battery percentage in mortification bar
i dont suggested for itso many software glitchsno gallary no speedeter only symbols appears in short menuno name on it how to identifyheating problems also
superb phone at an awesome price

the phone loses the signal even though it shows full strength i keep receiving missed call notifications seems like hundreds of people have confirmed this models signal issues one amazon exec promised a reimbursement but the systems were not working for a few days when i called back after some time they said they cant reimburse only replace the same model the model is faulty and i dont want it dont know what to do im willing to buy a more expensive phone from amazon but theyre throwing a policy which isnt mentioned when u buy sad and frustrated

amazing product at this price i really loved it
hi all  i am writing this review after a long time as i realised that people are missing noticing one big disadvantage of this phonei ordered this phone on the first day of its sale i got it in two days the day i got it i noticed that while you connect your phone to the charging and at the same time you keep operating the phone like watching youtube videos or surfing the facebook or wats app then it stops charging  i mean its battery percentage does not increases or it increases by 1 in 10 mins or sothe second thing i noticed is when you connect the phone through data cable to laptop or cpu then also it does not charges or charges with very slow rate like the one i mentioned abovei then asked for replacement as i thought there might be some defect in my sethowever even the set i got after replacement had the same issue finally i had to go for the return and refundi think this is a manufacturing defect which exists in all lenovo k8 note setsi therefore advise everyone to check this issue in their set and if its not a major concern for you then all other aspects of the mobile are greati hope this helps 
this product isnt appropriateheating problem camera quality not good
faulty product delivered not charging shuts down presently in service centre please dont buycheck the review section only 35 are positive i wish i had seen it before
battery problemheating problemaap open problemin all i gave 0 out of 10
the glass broke off within a month of purchase and asking rs5500 for original screen replacement in the official lenovo service centre poor quality of glass  other than that all features are nice  good camera sound is not coming through another set of speakers
worst phone ever i have wasted my money after update it took 8 to 10 hours for 50percent charging shame on lenovo for stupid product
the phone is good but the battery of this phone is too bad 
totally worst mobileit has hanging issue and app crashed are normal in this mobile even this mobile have deca core processorgo to redmi mobile that are cheaper than it and have better hardware option

i received a k8 note with mic problemthere was some lagging effectwhile using depth enable mode display clarity was not up to the mark heating problem not worthable for 14k only i loved the stock android ui
i meani got a faulty charger which makes a hissing sound when charging and it heats like you have some boiled water on your handsthe weight is okkthe phone heats a lot while playing games so they provided a cover but the phone is very good at gaming and my jio works perfect for mebut overall id give it a 410 rateing
sound quality is not good and it doesnt have volte support even15 gb is taken internal only
nice phone for 14000rs
first i would like to tell about amazon service its really too good they delivered a product within a daythe phone has aswome configuration in paper but when use it you will not feel that when you hold the phone itself you ll feel that you are holding some low cost chinese phonethe problems i have faced i 2 days1ok google command didnt work when i try to enable it said your microphone is not working2mobile internet rarely works but if you put in other mobile it works fine same is the case with signal strength as well3charging they mentioned fast charger but it takes 15 hrs for full charge4it heats up in 5min game also
mobile is good it has two speaker but one ist working
battery backup is very very poor it is not up to mark not like 4000 mh
charger is not working and mobile is also totally hang
phone is heating when charging after all is too good
good but camera quality is ok nd video not so clear
everything is good except camera quality

battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours not something good for buyingalso amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund they are asking for some local app to check the phone which doesnt have battery checking option
i bought lenovo k8 note to myself 2 weeks ago and i can say this without any doubt that it is the best phone in the price range of 12000 to 15000 rupees i am so much satisfied with the performance of the phone in every aspect the performance has been very good the best thing about the phone is its camera function and the quality of screen along with dolby atmos surround soundthe look and design of the phone is however little average in comparison to other phones of sam price range the look and design is very outdated but it still seems decentthe biggest usp of the phone has been its features it has 3gb ram with 32gb internal memory it has a dolby atmos surround sound with 35 mm jack the screen quality is also very good it is available for a price of rupees 13000 the model with 4 gb ram and 64gb internal memory is available for 14000 rupeesthe sound quality has been excellent in fact lenovo provides best sound quality in comparison to other phonesthe phone give the feeling of a good value phone with some great features and nice looking bodyit is a very userfriendly phone according to mei would definitely recommend this phone everyone who are in search of a very good phone with great features in the price range of under 15000 rupees i will rate this phone 45 out of 5 starsit is definitely worth the value for money
the phone is awesomeits a killer phone for killer pricethe camera could have been better other than that its top notch

respected sir i am writing this to you to letting you know that i purchased lenovo k8 note on 21 of augustwhich cost me ‚Çπ12999 and now with in 1 month the price of this phone decreased by ‚Çπ1000 which was very disappointing for me because i was one of the customers who showed interest in your product but after sometime you decreased the price it seems like you dont give importance to the customers who have faith on you i hope you got my point and explain me the reason behind this and also come with a solution of this problemas well as its having scratch on its screen since it is gorilla glass not expected so early thankyou 
dust can get in camera easily lenovo should do proper camera packing in handset
the phone is very good in terms of hardware and configuration however that on software part i didnt find andoird nougat that good it is lacking many features which its prior version lenovo k4 note was havingmany essential features like gallery phone recording etc are missing also the screen has curved edges so i am not able to find a proper tempered glass till date this phone is actually a motorola selling under the brand of lenovo lenovo product k4 note was much better
for the price it is just ok
very bad phone
i updated it for the latest os oreo not to good battery draining fast and charging is taking more than 5 hours to charge from 30percent to 70 percent
returned this product 2 times turbo charger didnt worked in both devices

very poor quality of chargerturbo charger stopped working within one month of regular use as directed by amazon we approached lenovo for replacement though under warranty their service centre is unwilling to replace it with a new one by giving various excuses like insisting for phone also to be returned back along with the charger the phone is working fine only adopter needs to be replaced then why are they insisting for phone i dont understand with normal charger it takes ages to fully charge
good product

i am anil kumar 9849468855 i am a user if lenevo a7000 it is very good with all options to have more space and speed i have booked lenevo k8 note with a microphone problem i got it replaced but i am not satisfied with the options in the phone viz no screen shot facility no cast screen camera lighting is not good no call recording no gallery which is a default in all other phones if these options are reviewed and updated by lenevo group this phone is best or otherwise i may be grateful if my phone is exchanged i bought this through amazon i am still having my lenevo a 7000 i am thinking to use that as if this is not updated with the above options hope lenevo will look after this to have more buyers in future as i think lenevo is good in its price and performance

good morning sir i vinod received the item on 23 oct 17 now today while charging i found that it is not charging it start charging when i change its usb cable with another usb cable however charger is working fine so kindly deliver me another usb cable for lenovo k8 note if possible i will be very thankful to you
camera is not goodwaste of money
its wonderful
small small problems is therewhen contacts is open phone was hanging
worst experience i purchased lenovo k8 note in the first flash sale from amazonin i was very excited to catch the phone thats why i ordered the phone with fast delivery option but when received it was worst experience its name is killer note just because it will kill your expectations excitementi did compare charging with my another phone charge percentage and duration were similar on both phones1 phone heats badly during charging browsing etc 43degree celsius temperature is dangerous the device can be blast2 corning gorilla glass noticeable major scratches on the display within a week while i am a very light user3 no nano coating fingers stains visible on the screen4 turbo charging does not work
battery discharge very fast
the mobile is very good but some issue on mobile 1all contact not seen on contact display 2play music dual speakers not working3call setting not builtin setting
very bad product
problems in bluetooth connectivity  i think bluetooth hardware is not of good quality
bola hai corning gorilla glass bc microsoft 535 mera unginat bar gira h firbhi uska glass nhi tuta ek crack bhi nhi aaya patthar pee kha kha gira h pr ye lenovo ek bar kya gir gaya aadhe glass ko crack aaya dont buy gyzzzz bichme hang bhi hota hai kbhibhi switch off but time ke bad hota hai fir
i would rate it 2 star being at price of 14000 it doesnt have gallery and music app which we need to search from play store and even though after installing several apps i am not satisfied with the 3rd party apps as compared to by default manufactureralso it comes with fast charging mode but taking 8 hour to charge from its 15watt adapterin 14000 there are so many options available and which are far better than this best is go with redmi
very good
not worth its cost heating issue is there and battery is drying fast
excellent product am using it for almost a month now but no problem at all
good
very bad experience with amazone they sale defective pieces in offer and not give replacementi bought lenovo k8 note its ear speaker not working
hot mobile return or replace items
poor product  i had to return it because of heat issue which was extremely bad  camera was good although
not satisfied with the cameraand displaytheir no difference between normal camera and depth focusing try to update the camera and some other featuresand provide a system update for k8 note users 
good  no heating  good performance good camera sound quality compare to k6 is not good  waiting for software fix from lenovo
the product is good build study in hand and feels good but due to mediatek the ideal battery drain is high the 40000 mah battery should give at lest 1 half day of battery life but thats not the case its just good for one day of use with moderate usage  overall the phone is powefull and a good overall package
the screen glass not as tough  i use an iphone and an k4 note on android befor this k8 and this one got two deep gashes on screen with normal usage of keeping it in the pocket  k4 screen was much durable than this  u better buy a screen guard along with this phone  it take longer to access files and photos when u put in 128gb card  also startup time lags after u download a few apps etc  not worth k8 should increase quality than k4 but in this phone its reverse  looking forward to my experience at service centre will post it later
dont waste ur money by buying this crapu may focus on the cost and feautres and get easily jealous to get this phoneu will regret as i didone of the worst phnalready i have retuned the same as per amazonpolicydefect in batterycharging and heating issuesthe saddest part is im getting a new same handset again
pretty well immersed with an optimum performance lenovo made a great piece1 great performance2 battery is long lasting3 great in hand feel4 built in quality is superb5 i loved itall above things are mentioned as looking at the price point of view and its concern i liked it alot
worst product dont but it anymore

phone with best features in the budget felt comfortable while using the handset battery is goodno lag while using the mobile the only problem is rear camera it takes to time focus on the objects with the rear camera i hope lenovo would resolve this issue with the upcoming updates  apart from this every thing is great best to buy under 15k
everything is good except battery backuponly 1day battery backup
well i m writing this review after using this phone for 5 days well this phone is not my first choice i want to buy redmi note 5 pro but flash sale goes out of stock in blink of eye so i ordered this device what i have concluded after using this1no lagging issue2no heating issue3battery backup is good but not as good like redmi note 4 which have the same size battery 4100 mah4camera is average if u guyz looking for depth mode or bokeh effect in this device then u feel disappointed because the image taken in depth mode is poor it hardly recognize the subject and it sometimes blur the edges of subject while the mi a1 and mi note 5 pro gave the best portrait mode and bokeh effect in the same price category5front camera is 13 megapixels but the image taken look like just 5 megapixels camera have taken it it have no sharpness and clear picture like 13 megapixels phone6if u like listening songs and watching movies then u have the benefits of dolby atmos sound system which gave good quality bass in the headphones dolby atmos equalizer provide the true sound and bottom speaker is also good with clear voice7turbo charger is the only name thing it took almost 2 hours to fully charge the phoneoverall i got this phone in 11k price which i found good to buy this device but if u are looking for camera than go for mi a1 or note 5 pro which is only 2k or 3k costlier than this phone but u have to go through the flash sale which again disappointment by redmii only got this device because it have dual sim  memory card system and dolby atmos support and it is cheaper than other phones with same featuresi hope u found this review helpful

i am using this product from last 37 days it is a pathetic phone with issue of display from day one and around 2 days back more problems aroused the phone suddenly get discharged at 50 and gets switched off also on recharging it does not recharges please keep yourself away from this junk of a product i am conned and does not want you all to be conned also at service center they will only format your phone and update software in spite of you complaining of the display problem i am facing the problem since last 37 days but for them the problem does not exist what a joke and fooling tricks these guys are trained forlenovo has made a junk and no other word fits better and above that the service team is a con stars employed just to fool the buyers so please resist yourself and buy anyother product instead my suggestionhighly upset with the whole experience

sup and excellent quality of camera
network issuelenovo customer care support is also not thereas well as calls are not connecting and signal is showing but for others it is getting switch off who are calling mewaste of üí∞ money
waste to buy this phone
wanted to give negative rating but its not practically possible buying this phone was one of the worst decisions ever taken by me the phone worked well initially however the heating issue started to show early and kept worsening with every day use further after updating to android oreo now phone gets heated insanely after few minutes of use also battery gets drained quite frequently dont waste your precious money on this piece of shit
mobile is no doubt gud but its showing its 4g handset and offer with idea but idea network didnt recognize this handset even 4g is not working and not eligible for 4g handset offers
phone is ok but there is problem with changeit is taking too much tym to charge it
best phone
no star rating bettry is to power only for half day
as i am using the phone from the last one find i dont find any big flawsbuild quality is good aluminium series 6000 looks finethe camera is very goodbattery last for 15 days you cant expect more than thisoverall its a great phone
dear staff i need headphones not there in box
battery is bad everything else is good
punda phone üòÇ its actual usb of the mobile is camera batter sound stock android ans soo on but its really worst in these segmentsdont trust these kinds of promotions
hangs in every few minute phone shaking problem bluetooth not working properly i will not suggest anyone to go to this phone  fed up with lenovo i was happy with one plus it was 100 perfect tried for the first time bad experience
heating probably leave k8 note
good product
redmi phones are lot more better than k8 note this phone more hot during normal usage
the phone is working the best i fell love with it
worst phone ever dont have basic apps like gallery and automatic call recordingand battery drains very quickly even in battery saver is onk4 note is more better than thisor else take lenovo x
overall good but problem with connectivity it has very low range of wifi connection
good product reached safe
have been using the lenovo k8 note now for over 4 months overall its a good phone but it was very disappointing to find out that the cast screen option doesnt work camera is decent can play heavy games without any lag has basic heating issues that every phone has nothing major though could overlook the heating issue for that matter 3 android updates received since i bought it but still didnt have any fixes for the cast screen
loving stock android after 3 months of use after paying 14k for this phone i would say dont buy it camera has worst quality in this price range when you view photos taken from this camera on computer then you will understand also no inbuilt gallery app google photos compresses photos reducing quality battery backup reduced after latest updateno 4k video recording
never buy it battery is very baddraining in standby mode very fast
specifications are very attractive but the user interface is very bad lenovo k8 note is lacking of1 no inbuilt call recorder2 no compass3 you can not cast screen4 no trash cleaner like other lenovo handset has
this generation phone nothing is unsatisfying rather than the battery as far as 4100 mah is concerned it should stay a lil bit more
its very bad
fantastic product very happy
mobile is good but the delivery is too bad
awsome
lenovo k8 note mobile is dammage mobile no buy more friends my mobile is very problem see

preforms gooddevice is bit heavy
battery drain very quickly
it is good product
nice phone
not meet my expectations with lenovo paid extra for one day delivery but recd after two days
excellent
the battery back up will make you cry a decacore processor not supported by battery back is just not acceptable it does not last even half a day the ultra fast charging is a hoax it does not charge from 15 to 100 in anything less than 67 hours
good phone but one problem no gallery
5 star means 5 out of five
i would give less than one star for this phone very bad signal receiving capacity after purchasing this phone i have a smart phone with no proper internet connectivity jio signal and internet works perfectly fine with my wife moto g4 phone this really sucksi would strongly recommend not to go for it
hey i also bought this phone  after 3 days of usage i think the phone is good the rear camera is not too good bt the front cam is awesome battery backup is superb stock rom is really very good overall the phone is good in this price segment as compare to other ones
super phone i like very much for this price 12k
awesome mobile overall performance is excellent good for those people who uses cell phone for official purpose throughout the day
multitasking mobile you can capture a lot moments with its long lasting battery love using insta on it fast loading with smoother experience best for insta lover

picture quality is best
fast charging doesnt work properlygoogle apps suddenly has stopped workingreplaced the phone after 6 days

‚Äúif i use phn during charging it takes 2 much tym to charge like 2 in 1 hour any 1 else who face this problem‚Äù otherwise no heating issue all works well sometimes on jio netwrk failsand front camera is not gud after clicking pics got blurred no sharpeness
the phone is quite stylish and its performance is up to notch in the category the battery is also powerful and can withstand 1 and half days after fully charged though turbocharging is provided you will hardly notice fast chargingthough mine can charge up to 6570 from 0 in one hour the only problem i am experiencing is that it does not show hotspot notifications or either detail about connected devices also there is no support provided by lenovo as i search for it
very much excitement when unboxing this product
many things are missinggreat amount of lagsno cast screencamera is goodram is not managed properlywaste of money
worst phone i used till date  auto rotation not functioning properly it rotate any time in any direction and very annoying  phone switch off when charged for longer duration  only one speaker is working out of two  bluetooth can be switch off after several attempt

original product by amazon
the best mobile for gamingheats up if used for a long timebattery drains a bit faster than expected but thats because of the deca core processor
the charger that has been provided has started malfunctioning after 1 month this is too annoying its not about going to the customer service and changing itits about time for which we resort to online shoppingbut at the end of the day we had to go to the customer service to get this rectified and sorted
not good when compare to k4 note camera not up to the mark as per specification
battery drainage in the backgroundalmost half headphone loudness is not enough it is a heavy phone audiophiles do not buy all in all you wont be satisfied instead go for mi a1

classic phone
great deal
pls dont buy lenovo k8 note the world worsts mobile
awesome featuresnice mobile
owsm productdont go on negative review
it is an awesome handset yesterday morning i got this and it actually made my diwali special camera quality is good and other features are also working cool battery back up is also good fast charging was also there many more to explore
quality not best
good phone with extraordinary features in budget range
the mobile overall is ok due to higher specifications such ram 4 gb internal memory 64 gb and provision for memory card and some other features but lacks few important features that other models k4  k5 notes have k8 does not have power saver setting which greatly helps to save battery power when data connection is not required it also does not have scheduled power on and off setting which also very useful to save battery power on account of this the battery runs down very quickly sound reproduction in k5 note is much better than in k8 also misscalls and new sms are not shown on the screen icons but one has to specially click on the icons to check difficult to know why lenovo k8 manufacturers overlooked this important features also photos and videos cannot to be accessed directly from the camera screen but one has to access from the gallery or file manager
not satisfied with the camera and overall experience
cast screen is not being done with my smart tv like lenovo k3 note without help of google chromecast issue this problem this is cheating in higher version set lenovo k8 note
yeh sabse accha chalne wala mobile hai lenovo the best product

reviving again this phone has network connectivity issue and bluetooth issue all these days i was wondering on network and after changing sim to other phone found out issue with lenovo itselfprevious reviewlooks good with one day use as of now fully charged mobile will give you 24 hours battery backup with average usagedesign is nice lenovo could have reduced the bottom and top space given for camera and menu buttons other wise it is nice fingerprint button is at the right place for handy usagei am adding to my previous comments  if you are looking for a great camera this is not for you camera is not at all of good quality picture minor heating problem is there while used continuously or during continuous gaming charge back up is still good
completely satisfied good phone under average price
product is good initially i thought of battery issue now it is solved and performance is overall good
killer note

i bought this phone from amazon last week i am not a mobile phone gamer and just need the phone for normal stuff like music emails etc i wont review the other aspects but just want to make you aware about one particular issue that i am facing with this phonethe bluetooth on this phone does not work it keeps disconnecting from the devices it is connected to i have tried it with my car audio as well as jabra conference call speakers that i have all my other phones work with them with 0 issues this phone just doesnt work it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every 45 seconds or so its really annoying and makes the phone virtually useless for me i am forced to keep another phone in my car now and i am forced to use that phone for conference calls why did i buy this phone i wonder i can understand a unit being defective but amazon is not taking it back for an exchange when i go to return link it just installs a fraud perfomance measurement app which tells me that everything is fine with the phonehey amazon i wont become poor if you dont replace this phone but please know that i will never again buy high value items from this site ever again if you dont get your act together and provide me with an exchange at least

lenovo phone after sales service is pathetic and quality of phone motherboards is very very cheap my previous model of killer note series went dead just after more than a year having spent close to 14 k one would at least expect 23 years lifespan in the long run these phones may not be worth the money you spent

after using the phone for approx 15 days i am writing this review my first opition abt the mobile is it is half cooked product with lots of issues1 battery drain very fast and you will never get the feeling that the mobile have a 4000 mah battery infact if you are heavy gamer or music lover than never forget to keep the powerbank with yourself2 if you are using the jio sim than this mobile is not for you because if you left the phone idle for more than 5 mints than the caller will get the message than the no is either switched off or outof coverage area for the other operator also network reception is very bad and this is generalised problem lenovo forum is already flooded with this problem and user from all over india is facing this issue3 camera is good if you give some timeand more issues like battery drainage slow charging etcin my opinion dont go with mobilethere are lots of other options available with the better configuration in the same price range
hangs and heating issue after nougat update
its a beastcamera is greatrest all spl features are equally good
every time it is taking more than 3 hours to charge from 15 to 100 in switch off and airplane mode i think i received a defective product
im been using for 7months on spec wise its a pretty solid one on build quality its not up to bthe mark it says that corning gorilla i really dont know what it has mean  my display got broken with in 2months of purchase average quality casting will not work by defaultdont update oreo once you got the software update just ignore or else your feel hell on the name of killer
worst phone ever i bought it on 21 of august and after a month it has incoming problem i really felt bad and i want to return it and get my money back china you fail all the time
excellent phone in this segmentusing from last 1 monthstill searching for any drawaback but didnt found
very good battery backup good camera overall value for money
nice and product was goodbut i dont understand why they are not providing headphones with deviceno problem at all except this
satisfied with the price n qualitytrue comparison with honor 6xits better than iti hd used bothbokeh mode is super better then 6x
phone seems to work very fast the gui also seems to very good something wrong with the battery drain issues idle time only takes a lot on battery drain though with 4000 mah phone needs to be charged twice charging also takes a lot of time maybe the further software updates might fix these issues but still these teething issues is not giving me confidence to keep this phone for long camera is not clicking good photos during sunlight lenovo pick up your socks on software updates

hi allas lenovo launched this phone as killer note it is honestly a killer one today im posting my reviews im using this phone from last one week there are some pros and some cons toogood ones deca core processorslim and sleek designpowerful and quick responselighting fast fingerprint sensorfeather touchbrighter displayfeels classybrilliant front camerano heating problemno lagging or hang problemareas of disappointment 1 rear camera  it was not as good as to be there is some lack of stability and photo quality is not up to the mark2 battery life  though it is 4000 mah but it didnt last for a day as this is my new phone but battery drains within a day3 screen quality  previously i was using samsung note 3 so might be a bit biased but as per k8s screen resolution this problem should not come thought screen is bright enough but it shows some unexpected errors or lack of smoothness was observed while playing videos4 earphones  this is a very awkward cheap cost cutting techniques i was very surprised when i didnt found earphone in the box this is really unexpected so that i remove one star out of five5 packing quality  packing quality from amazon was very poor phone was packed in just a piece of cardboard only no bubblesheet no protection against water damage handling damageso that 3 out of 5 starsthis is allbut i must say if you want a powerful and stylish phone within the budget you must go for it
good
fairly good
awesome productkilling processornice performance but camera is average in low lightshutter speed is also not to the expectation
totally this mobile is awsme front came jst ok perfomance wise good
phone is good but delivery was late
no earphones on this mobile
turbo charging is not working properly and camera has minor cons but overall product is good
camera performance no android version not expanded me
a good smartphone under 15000 rs best prossecer awesome camera front flash is good for selfiesdollby speakers are unbeatablelong time battery life all over a nice smartphoneonly heating issue is a negative point
battery backup is very badbad performance heating issue batter issue camera problem network catches very low strength
mobile is very very good but too heating problem  charge lasting problem i think battery is not good
there are two rear camera but one of them is not working
pathetic experience with lenovo k8 note1 cast is not working2 second sim slot is only for 3g instead of 4g as described3 call recording option is missinglenovo is making fool of its customers
a good phone from lenovobuilt quality  okuser friendly  yesbattery life  greatcamera  good nice selfie phonei used this for video vlogingsome times it get power off it self
phone build quality is good but slightly heavylenovo always have back finger print scanner which works well even though expecting for a front finger printbattery back up is ok which gives 9 hrs with continuous screen on time
excellent
this is worst phone do not buy this phone both amazon and lenovo is cheating with us each and every feature is worst
please read the full review herethis phone is one big mess it hardly manages 6 hours of screen on timeforget about lasting a full dayi got a maximum of 6 hours of sot and a minimum of 4 hours 30 minutes on a single chargeim a light to medium useri use 3g with 2 hours of mobile data and 45 hours of wifiif you are thinking you can make a day with the phone you are wrongplease do not make this mistake and dont go for positive reviews if the phone has been really positive it had a score of 4 or more and not many people have reviewed this phonethe camera quality is ok ok with the depth effect still to be enhancedperformance is awesome but battery life really killed the phone 4000 mah battery doesnt seem to help at allredmi note 4 gives better battery performance of 8 to 9 hours of sot with exactly similar performancei dont think you should expect software updates and hope things will get better in the future that is how lenovo worksrelease stupid phone and make money from stupid peoples like usbut if you still wanna buy god help you

i like everything about this phone good sound quality good picture quality value for money package
i got my lenovo k8 note 16 sep today 18 only two and im facing problem am happy with most of its featureshowever the much touted rapid charging through its turbo charger does not happen at all it takes about 5 hours for a full charge this is extremely slow is anyone else facing this problem i cannot find 15w charging written anywhere on my charger what is this problem lenovo engineers wake up and do something
not good phone

i reveived the phone but back cover is seems like used one it got scratches and phone box is also seems used
headseat and sim ejuct pin not available
good handset 
speaker problem in few days  in dual cameras 5mp camera does not work  battery backup not good compare to redmi note 4
an excellent device very premium look and feel camera quality best at this level i rate only the cool1 above this lots of space 4gb64gb and no lag issues havent done extreme gaming but otherwise it exceeds expectations for businesspersonal functionsuntweaked android allows you to customise apps that you are already used to sound quality is by far the best in similarly priced phonesonly con for me right now is the longish boot time all in all highly recommend
product is really good worth for rs 13000 and battery is also powerfull with one day usage with all the features overall a nice product from line from lenovo thanking yourkumaresan
best smartphone at this budget
very nice and exactly fitting for lenovo k8 mobile
it is not worth it is not like lenovo note5 with experience of note 5 k8 is even lower than note 5 very bad experience the contact gets lost the saved nos gets lost dont waste money
too much heating issue
excellent product thanx lenovo thanx amazon
very nice phone in this budget segment 23ghz processor very good speed  3g  4g connectivity fantastic camera  fingerprint sensor response will never annoyed battery backup is make it very much comfortable
loss of moneyworst phone bcz worst battery backupbatteey not supported particular 1 day without usei feel that i m using 2000mah battery phone
selfie camera not up to 13 mp expectationsboth camera depth and richness is like 2 mp camera in low lighting conditiondelivery is great in time
awesome phone üì±
overall its a good phone only disappointment for me is with camera camera was not upto mark both front and back dual camera also not working proper with depth sensei am expecting some improvements in coming updates
the cast feature doesnt work no devices are found it wont even search for devices the vr function is out of sync it doesnt support they boast in their launch event that its a theatre max they didnt even properly checked whether the vr basic videos can be played in it what a disgrace the images are out of sync and shows as 2 images during watching the sound effect is pretty good and performance and battery is good but the vr and cast bugs are the worst possible reasons to hate it
screen bakvas he
overall phone is oktime shown wrong on home screenbattery backup is too goodrest all r okbest phone
very nice phone
good product
good product in this rategood service amazon 
received in good condition
excellent
its very good product
not bad
phone speed and efficiency is good gaming is also good but the major drawback is that phone heats up pretty bad when charginggaming and when online everything else is a beautiful craft battery drains a bit faster than expected the phone arrived the next day i ordered so service is good too display is good
revising my earlier review written about 4 months ago in which i gave 5 starsthe biggest problem is battery which is getting worse with each system update its 4000 mah battery is worse than a contemporary similar phone with 3000 mah battery something seriously wrong and the irony is no serious effort by lenovo to rectify it barely after 4 months of the purchase i have to recharge the phone twice every day it now seems the problem is beyond redemptionsecondly i am not able to send the image from photos to a folder on selecting the image without being online
nice smart phone it is with great build quality and high end performance
gazab mobile h camera faddu and hang to hota hi nhiii bilkul bdiya phone h üíØ

unhappy with amazon fake promotional offer  marketing schemes and dual beahaviour in customer handlingpros1 turbo charging2 touch is scratch resistancecons1 you will not get a headphone in the package2 amazon promised to give motorola sports headphone in rs 699 but at the time of purchase i was unable to get one later amazon denied this offer3 phone is bulky4 dual camera functionality is hidden and not ui friendly5 speakers sound is noisy6 battery discharge faster than expected7 both sim not running 4g at a time
very good looking phone while seeing featurewise but there are many worst things compared to previous lenovo phones1 the keys at the bottom ie back key and shortcut key are reversed as they were in k4 or k6 etc very foolish how does an existing lenovo user can upgrade to this phone even all other qualities are good the basic operation of mobile is very difficult the back key must be on right side for easy and one hand operation2 these keys must be led otherwise it is difficult to find them in darkness and on gold colour phone it is very difficult to find them3 there are no stereo speakers  one at top and other at bottom  then why have to boast about dolby atmos with ear phones there will not be much difference whether dolby atmos is on or off in k4 note the stereo speakers are the best i am using it from 8 months very good 3d sound  but you cant get from k8 note4 in addition to play button on side additional 2 buttons previous and next are to be provided then this will be an excellent music phoneoh god please gift us k9 note with all specs as of k8 note and speakers as in k4 note with back key on right side   d goury manohar reddy

best handset
in dual camera mobiles it is the best phone
battery charging is very very slow and drained from 100 to 10 with in two hrs hearing problem
its very fantastic one i got a new one for my whole expectations thank you amazon
a real killer basic bluetooth function does not work buyers google for lenovo k8 note bluetooth and you will find lot of complaints on lenovo forums they have still not managed to reslolve it it does not connect to my garmin nor does it connect to car stereo connection breaks off frequently i do not even have the option of returning itmy second disappointment with lenovo in 6 months never againdoes not even have ant which i though would be a basic feature it would manage to carryi am not someone to spread negative reviews and this is the first time that i am so disappointed with a product that i have to post a negative review i always used to think that those who post negative reviews are paid off by competitors but thanks lenovo i now trust all naysayers 
nice phone but some features are missing like call recording screen casting connecting to pc message tone etc
its a nice phone to use and nice brand m happy to buy it
good battery backup and a high performance processor which keeps you in top speed
configuration is good but handset get heated quickly and 4000mh battery doesnt provide 50 performance of said capacity it doesnt provide backup for full day and need to charge twice a day in morning and in evening to keep running handset
i guess this phone is good but wherever amazon delivers are defective pieces please dont buy this phone here
attractive product

battery is getting drained faster my jio sim is not working without internet connection services centres are very less nobody help me battery is the claimed 4000 mah it performs less than 3000 mah i am completely fed up and i wasted a lot of time and money i am going to return it
very bad mobile phone üòîüòî
using for more than a year still running good no issues till now
one of the best buys i have done the only thing is the battery life wish the battery lasted a bit longer battery lasts 24 hours with extensive data usage i am not much of a gamer but the speed is super awesome features are brilliant stock android is great
dont buy as phone doesnt ring after 10 minutes of screen off
super phone

first camera not working
few problems i am facing with this phone battery drains too fast lags in audio output in bluetooth devices such as speakers and headphones no option to turn on miracast or screen mirroring network issues camera is not that great average camera with worst ever bookeh effectlenovo should fix this issue in next update otherwise it will lose another customercustomers are not the priority for lenovo that is for surelenovo please take care of this issue do not make rubbishafter oreo update it is getting worsefunctionality of phone getting worseheadphones not working battery is getting discharged so easilyheating up issues while charging as well as when not in use with with 20 to 30 dischargethis is for you lenovo please release update to fix these issues
mst phone camera results v gudlittle heating problemturbo charger not working good take 3 hrs to full charge
the phone is nice and camera quality is quite good but the bokeh mode is just fine
overall the phone is good but in just 15 days i found a problem with the proximity sensor the screen would get activated while talking and gps etc would get activated also while playing games the display brightness fluctuates now its too late to return the phone update 20062018its just about 6 months so thought of sharing an update the specs of this phone are very impressive and i loved using the phone but thats about it here are the problems i faced1 proximity sensor defective the phone screen would sometimes not switch off and gps airplane mode etc would get activated accidentally while talking2 bluetooth connectivity is horriblesometimes the sound would completely get broken up making it impossible to use it with bluetooth headphones3 while typing a message random characters would automatically get typed and even after deleting them some more would again appear had to quit the application and try againmy earlier phone was a lenovo k4 note and within 3 months the screen started getting a yellow smudge on one side then started the problem with random characters getting typed that phone didnt last a year seeing the impressive specs i again went for lenovo k8 note bad mistakeunless lenovo gets their quality issues sorted out they are in for a tough time ahead i have had enough of lenovo phones sold my phone within 6 months
turbo charging has no sense in it lenovo provided 3a charger with turbo charging it takes 2 hours to full charge from 0 to 100 if i doing nothing heating very much frequently close many apps some reviewss says that it charge 40 in 20 minutes is totally wrong as i am experiencing as camera and battery just average this phone is below the average phone its cost should have been under 10k

awesome handset for gamingany game is run smoothly in this phone
some of the basic software features are missing like1 the option for scheduled power onoff is not there2 the option for customised ringtone is not there3 the option for hotspot metering like in lenovo k3 note is not there
i was using lenovo k3 note before i bought this phone with great expectations but it is not at all up to the mark1 camera quality is very poor2 heating issue the phone heats even after 5 mins of using camera and charging3 battery drains very fast even when the phone is idle4 whatsapp and mail led notification not working5 display video and camera sharpness is not good over sharp6 microphone is not working properlyonly  5 star given for amazon delivery fastservice excellentand customer support is brilliant
unhappy for this product

heating problem so dont buy lenovo mobiles
battery backup is very bad dual camera is a joke in this phone overheating problem not a killer smartphone much better phones like lenovo p2 and redmi note 4
that mobile phone feature is awesome but u perform any task the phone heating like as charging  tethering open and using more time rest of the phone is awesome
battery performance is low and phone is getting heat quickly
awesome mobile phone
very good
good product
build quality multi tasking is good camera quality is not up to mark and phone heats too much while using camera secondary camera is just gimmick nothing to do with audio while listening through good quality head phone is very good and event external speakers are loud enough overall good product from lenovo with minor flaws like over heating while camera use battery back up getting 15 days with moderate use if you use heavily then only one day you will get as oreo update is promised with google security peaches on time and a clean google operating system without bloatware you can live with this well built phone not recommended for those who looking for phone with good camera

this phone is just about okit feels good in the hand sturdy and bodybut thats where it ends1 the phone ringer is pretty low  you cannot hear the phone in a different room even if it is at full volume2 there is some issue with the firmware because of which alarms keep getting missed regularly even with 3rd party apps3 after 6 months it has become slow4 for some reason any gallery app i use cannot access the sd card  tried several things but does not work5 most importantly  the data network goes on an off intermittently and is extremely slow after showing to the lenovo care store they kept it for 5 days and then asked me to take it back since they were yet not able to figure out the issuebetter products are available in the market dont go for this one

good phone camera quality is also goodfast downloading speed
low single depth camera not working
i dont like this phone
maybe lenovo is going down hill i had been using lenovo products and fell in love with them since 2012 but this this is a jokecomplains 1 when i first use it start up took around 8 minutes and even getting longer and longer the more often i restart the phone2 when on call the volume automatically starts to come down to the lowest3 camera zooming is terrible front cam is terrible cant even take or screenshot a single while recording in video4 battery need to be charged 24 times every single day and night5 lots of heating up when used or in charging mode6 phone hangs aloti cant believe lenovo has launch such a terrible phone even the lenovo k5 note was better which i had used before
ok
i like this phone killer note battery backup is good compare with other phone camera quality awesome charge within 1 hour if u switch off the phone
this phone good performance this phone rear camara is not good and battery capacity is good anyone mobile unbeatable it performance in this mobile

lenovo new system update till not there but amazon site purchase new mobile is mention new system software update but there is no ore 800 update plsa help
good mobile phone at this price range value for money
heated several times otherwise good phone with great stock android expirience
the best part is i love it the model of phnlittle bit heatup while charging but that could be negligible
yesa new mid ranged dual camera phonethis phone can be your daily driverbut dont except more from itthe specs are preety goodbut i think its is overpricedthe camera quality is goodbut i dont find it amazingyes one thing i really like is the near stock android expirience with nougutand one bonus is the front flashthatmay be a life saver in darkat the end i think if you are giving 14000 approxyou can buy mi a1 for only 15000
one of the best smartphones that you can get in this price range stock android makes it even better camera is average battery can give you full 1 day backup also takes less time to charge thanks to turbo charger im fully satisfie with my purchase
cash back ki baat boli gae thi jo avi tak toh nahi millano star frm my side
a very good phone in the 13k budget extra memory slot is biggest advantage
compared with mi4 note i found it wrong investment
the mobile which i purchase cheap as compared to the market price their picture are too good overall everything of the product are good
good
becasue it is waste of time
lvd it

excellent smart phone

after using lenovo k8 note for 4 days i came up with several bad experiencescons1 mobile charging was taking 810 hours for charging and sometimes more than that2 very poor quality sound while using headset3 mobile application operating speed slow4 no inbuilt gallery and music player5 network range always fetching up and down so battery drains quickly6 automatically ringer volume shown on the screen7 a bit heavy too8 no turbocharger charging effectüòé if two or more application opened mobile sometimes gets hangi am totally unsatisfied with lenovo k8 note hence will not recommend anyone to purchase this phone they are not providing refund instead they are providing replacement after getting this much flaws i was thinking of other company mobile options after this many issues who will try to be part of risk of getting new product good for proof i am adding images which shows mobile charging taking almost 10 hours showing at the bottom of imageprosmobile appearance goodcamera quality good
good phone not a great onecamera quality not satisfied as per the specificationsbut goodmoto xplay have great colour display and clarity than lenovo battery performance superi can able watch a full one day cricket match with 4g and 30 percentage remaining after match7 hoursgood processor speedyou can buy without hesitation because the price is not high as per the specifications offered
i want replacement
good phone
everything is good except the specific music key its slightly under the phone with half tilt and doesnt working
good phone but camera quality is not better than samsungapplication occupie more space in ram
mobile is very good we do not get scratch guard and earphone so far very much happy with the performance
lenovo bunch of waste people just no response for there utter flop software update they turning the good handset into bombs by the latest update after the latest update  god i was confused did i pircjase a mobile or iron box
super mobile
k
cast screen mirroring option not working dont know whether they provide updates soon or not
something is good and some is bad
3rd class mobile charging problem 
been using this device for last 90 days or so and here are my findings about itcons1 rear camera perfomance is average even with the patch update the photos feel average the bokeh effect is absolutely below par2 battery life is below average despite being a 4000mah  the device does not last a 1 day even on medium usage the phone idle and screen it self consumes half the power the recent update made the battery life worse3 despite having a fingerprint scanner it does not have native app lock feature and we have to download a third party app for locking apps4 memory management is not up to the mark on first boot out of 3gb only about 12 gb was free despite being a stock android it has a heavy memory footprint despite not having any apps installed5 signal reception even on strong coverage areas is poor tested with ideajiovodafone all show very weak signal strength my other honor device has no issues picking up signal at the same locations6 turbo charger failed to live up to its potential after the recent november update the device takes more then 110130 minutes to fully chargeworthwhile to note all the above problems could be solved via better ota updates but lenovo does have a strong update policy because of which earlier devices performed poorly after launchpros1 great build quality device feels very premium thanks to the series 6000 aluminium build2 stock android os offers up a lag free operation3 dolby sound is a very good offering even without stereo speakers the device outs good audio4 the front camera with flash is a good feature and the camera does perform well
last offer purchase my mobile rs12999 now live offers rs11999 i am upset mind
good
superb performancesimply superb
hi teamthis is the second time im purchasing this phone and im really sorry to say thiscompared to the first purchase this one is certainly a defective piececase in point  the sound clarity in the previous one was so good youd be actually feeling the entire sequence of events however considering this piece youve senti cant stop saying how resentful i am of this contraptioni would like a replacement for the product as soon as possible

phone is good for use it does all the task easily  but there are some software bugs which are not addressed by lenovo in last updates it does show some minnor lags sometime
battery is draining fast even without use scrapproduct even without the usage the phone charge is draining fastly
got some heating issues otherwise its good one to pick in this budget
bad product experience
back camera is not gud front camera is amazing üíó
after a month onlyfound that only one speaker is working not satisfied with the productreturn window is also closed now i have to go for service manufacturing and quality check department didnt do their job wellpurchasers please check whether this fault is in your handset also

everything is excellent about the mobile  stands best in performance battery also good camera is awesome
this mobile processor very hot
first of all no other phone in this price have cameras both primary and secondarybetter than this phone  with a mediateks deca core chipset its quite faster in multiple operations but ya it drains battery faster in compare to snapdragon  but it can be managed though companys software updatesecondly its really tougher in term of built quality it have a nanocoting protection for water resistivity  it can even work after bent and it also have a gorilla glass protectionall these features are available in just 13000 which are missing in xiomi note4 honor etc lying in same price range
1 star for its so called gorilla screen i purchased the mobile just 25 days before and my screen broken i was the proud user of kenobi vibe k5 note but this is just bakwas
no fucher normal mobil only
superb mobile
i m reviewing on this after one week of use  plz dont listen to other comments  its got the awesome camera in this class even better thanmoto g5s plus and redmi note 4  decacore processer is also best in its class  battery is decent  buy this without any second thought  it will pay u all the money u spend

not a good product many issues in headphone jack software apps shuts done suddenly not gud camera in love light
its the jack of all trades but king of none battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor battery drains quite fast camera is better than average and i think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone kinda bums me outupdate after 3 day usebattery back up is really horrible normal usage like whatsapp and instagram browsing consumes more than 25 battery in an hour or sothen there is turbocharging issue it starts with fast charging then after 1020 minutesdepending upon mood rate decreases it took 7 hours to charge it by 40 in totalwould really appreciate if amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models i personally would not trust my 14k bucks with lenovo or moto from this point on

hiii alli have used this phone from last 3 dayshere is my reviewpros1 the metal body gives a classic and stylish look2 internal memory 64 gb in this range awesome with 4 gb ram3touch is very good with full hd4video recording in slow motion is also available5new processor is fast but not as compared with snapdragon 825cons1 the camera quality is very poor though it has extra camera in backsimilarly front camera of 13mp is not up to mark and its look like fake images2battery which claimed to to be of 4000mah is just like 3000mah of samsung or other phonesit drains out within 1624hr time3turbo charginglenevo just fooling customers in this section it takes almost 25 hr to charge complete mobile4it doesnt have separate ring volume adjustment for media alaram message etc5no headphones provided by lenevo in this set
camera performance is some what satisfied but overall good device
its the worst mobile set i ever purchased no battery backup nothing good with this android system 
i am using this phone since one monthi liked the soundcamera big internal memory 64 gbhowever only 50 gb is available for the use but this is also enoughgood this about this phone is dolby sound and turbo charger which charges phone quickly and 4000mah battery easily last for 1 day even after watching videosusing internet thanks amazon for good packing and service

i purchased this phone on 25th august hence writing this review after almost 35 months of usethere are problems i have with this phone1 clock if you are using the phone with display on the clock doesnt change it remains still you wont realize the time even after 30 minutes its annoying2 wifi it doesnt connect to the wifi every time you may have to restart this device to get it done3 heating the phone heats up during charging and heavy usage4 battery my previous phone with 3500 mah lasted more than this phones 4000 mah the battery performance is bad according to me5 full charge it takes more than two hours for the phone to get charged6 display display is okay if you are an amoled fan you will be disappointed with thisgood points1 performance 4gb ram does justice to phones performance no lags noticed even with heavy usage and many apps2 camera camera quality is good also the portrait modeat 13999 i believe there are better options in the marketoverall rating 35
compared to all brands in this range like motonokiasamsung it gives complete value for money whether it is batterystoragecamera videosoundstyle or any other criteria k8 note is unbeatable in rs15000 range anybody can blindly go for it
i go value for money the battery lasts 2 days simplistic nothing fancy and ostentatious value for money spent both lenovo and motorola are good reasonable budget phones
good phone dont buy for dual camera setup
excellent accept heating issuecam battery
excellent phone must buy
product is good but heating problem and battery drain is biggest i bought this on 1st march this year sometimes very slow i want to replace it now also while typing it takes wrong words
awesome experience of a smart phone100 out of 100 the superb change which is in this mobile is not felt till now is heating problem in lenevo mobilesthe only thing required is to provide lenevo headphonesfor experiencing the dolby atmosphere
voice recorder is not thereand gallery tooonly google photos is not enoughrest is best

have used it for couple of days now phone feels goodbut battery is disappointing
in this lenovo k8 note no dual 4g sim support and sometimes it stucks
worst phone with worst services
pathetic phone it always overheats after using large applications after 8 months the phone had a starting problem and the circuit board was 100 damaged as it was the software problem the service center took 200rs charge just to inform that the phone is no good and upon repairing it will cost 17000 which is hysterical cz its more than the price of phone it was not covered under warranty as there was a minor crack on its cover please dont waste your money for this crappy phone also the service center experience was negative and least helpful
camera quality is not bad otherwise ok but its too costly when compared mi phone
not compair with samsung j7 series
i bought this phone one week before and returned within a week it was not that great as it has specification i was not able to pick up call because of display issuelook normal phonememory excellentcamera very gooddisplay normalprocessor not as per spec

lenovo k8 note is on paper the best phone in budget phone segment its a killer phone only if you go by specifications otherwise its a total wastage of your 1314kthe build quality is ok nothing in this phone is above average either it is average or below averagelet me tell you why one should not buy it1 i used jio sim for my lenovo k8 note the problem is when the phone remains idle for 10mins or something it goes in standby mode ie if someone calls me the caller hears that the phone is switched off but in actual phone is not switched off the moment i unlock the phone and someone calls me at that time it works fineso its the biggest disappointment it feels i bought video game for 14k and this is not happening random it happens every time when phone remains idle for more than 10mins2 network connectivity network connectivity is very poor in this phone i tried sim cards from same service provider at same location in two different handsets out of which one is lenovo k8 note and my observation is the other handset gets full network signal but lenovo k8 note always shows onetwo bar less and that affects the call quality3 even though it is having 4000mah battery the battery performance is very poor it drains very fast even in idle condition4 if you are movietv series lover and spend most of your time watching videos on phone then this phone will irritate you things is when you watch videos on this phone the screen gets flickering every now and then it is the most irritating thing even after turning auto brightness mode off the screen keeps flickering5 stock android at its worst in this phone6 dolby atmos is not doing any magic normal music output7 the hard keys power volume music are not firm it is very loosely connect and having too much play even your older phone may not have that much play even after years of usage8 microphone output is very low so no good calling experience it may be because of poor network connectivity as i mentioned earlier9 dual camera feature has nothing special even third party apps can provide better results than this so called depth mode camera feature overall average camera output10 no backlight for soft keys you have to keep searching for soft keys in darknessall above drawbacks are not specific to my phone only as i faced these problems i searched for solution online instead of finding solution i found out many people are having similar issues with their lenovo k8 noteapart from phone i give full marks to amazon for the hassle free return of lenovo k8 noteamazon should refrain itself from selling this phonehope my review will help people who wants to buy this killer phone

are you are a hardcore gamer and needs performance rather than camera if yes definitely go for it
unbelievable phone
excellent device with unique features
great features but the only disappointment is that earphone is missing from the pack it came as a real shocker that after investing inr 13999  still dont get a earphone
this is not a complete productbattery backup is very badusing time it is very hot
low price
this is one of the best phone

phone is good but there were too much heating problem of this phone after 4 months of using will charging itpleaseeeee amazon replace this phone too new lenovo k8 note
poor battery performance it gets drained very fast and do not charge phone quickly no turbo charging
a decent phone on budgetpros nice specs at this price brightnesscons the biggest drawback is music and sound quality dolby atmos is useless and is given to fool people even the older lenovo devices have got far better sound i am a music lover and purchased this device but super disappointed nowupdate mobile suddenly stopped working within 3 days of usage it is not powering on now waiting for resolution from amazons end
except camera quality mobile performance is good
pretty good phone camera is awesomebattery lasts 2days over all a good buy
very worst handset it doesnt have direct casting instud it requires google crome to connect smart tv as the phone have 4000mh batter the phone doesnt last for a day even without internet when we call to coustomer care regarding the direct casting they speak very lightly the lenova k5 note was far better then k8note i guess this all have happened coz of motorola tookover the lenova product
nice
best mobile at this price
worst battery performancebattery drains very fast on standby
nice satisfied to this product
worst product dont buying in any onephone working slowly and handle notsmooth
horrible product first i received this product without any earphones now about a week after purchase while getting into my quilt i mistakenly put my hand on it and discovered the screen cracked as a resultwhat a waste of money dont know what recourse i have at this point
i am using this phone and find phone is getting heat camera is not good as expected battery is also not good as expected 
i have read lot of reviews after buying the product and thought the reviews were some bad experience with few people and there were few positive reviews as well hence went on to buy this product i was using a k3 note beforemy review based on a weeks usagepositives1 good camera2 good speed3 good battery charge4 good storagenegatives1 call quality bad basic requirement of a phone2 dolby atmos performance bad doesnt even match with my k3 noteplanning to return the phone
superb mobile for 11000 but software issue cant use some applications
turbo charger not properly working purchased date only properly workingwaste product
my name satish chavhan
i got mobile with cover and there is problem in front cameralow class images in front camera but rear camera is goodi confirmed from other friends but they got mobile without cover and their front camera is okmobile having some software issue alsothis was my last product of amazoni will not buy any product from amazon today onwards
nice phone
full review in short good phone and smooth experience but some cons1depth enabled camera is not that goodnormal camera is crystal clear2update doesnt seem to make any difference3overheat when on 4g4screenguards available does not fit the screen as it is a bit curvedpros1front camera rocks during the day2scrath resistant screenreally3includes microsoft wordexcelpowerpoint etc4big screen for smooth use5vr stunnsan indepth photo attached alongwith normal ones
packaging sucks there were bubbles an on screen some scratches on back cover too but most of all the sim ejector tool is missing never gonna buy lenovo products again
worth it but the sound quality is good but the volume level of the speakers in not up to the mark even in earphone too
best product and amazing delivery
signal range is poor
good phone with lesser price
its a good product i m fully satisfied with it and i really love its camera
great experience with tis amazing product from lenovoit is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone requireddeca core processor long lasting battery and 64gb internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesomei would certainly recommend this phone for users having usage and game lovers
average mobileso many issue i think this is west of money
battery not so longer to use
horrible experiencei have got a vimbar instead of this phoneplease do something immediately
didnt like it too much like i do my k5 note selfie camera doesnt have mirror settings may be some update will be there in future further more camera is not that good dual camera is only for show doesnt do anything good one strange thing i noticed is missing headphones they are writing it in description but not available in box
good productworth moneyof not looking for extraordinarily camera this is for you to grab
battery is not long lasting it doesnt feel like 4000 mah  started getting hot by continuous using some times it slow while using
very element phone in this category having very nice front and dual camera
decent phone to price tag found satisfactory in all termsafter using mi3 red mi 3sred mi 4red mi 5and some of samsung motos found better
pros1performancedeca core is good2storage52gb  is good3ram4b performance is quite satisfactory no hang has observed so far4 camera takes some really good pics in day light and nowhere in this price range you are gonna get 13 megapixel front camera with a selfie flash5 people who love to have a lot of multimedia content in their phone as 52 gb of storage is quite enought for that kind of users6 fingerprint sensor is amazing and far better than any andoid phone i have ever used youll hardly get to clean it for months7 since it is already aiming with corning gorilla glass so no need to add any screen guard as it can handle even knife point so details you can check its screen resistance in youtube videos8 splash resistant so if by mistake you pour out your tea or water you will have your phone fully working without any damage9 screen angle is very good so you can view movies by all possible angles10 that music key is really awesome especially for the people who listen music and headphones and their phones usually keo in their pocket so next time you dont have to take out your phone and then change the track your can simple do it by double pressing music keycons1camera is not up to the mark even my mi4i camera was better than this one especially in low light areas2 if you are a kind of person who listen music at loud volume then this phone is not for you as its maximum loundness is very low as compared to other phones even my iphone 5s sounds better in my headphones than this one3 updates will be delayed so if you are excited for the android oreo than you have to wait till july and june of 2018 as this is their officially announced date for the updates4back panel captured your sweat finger print pretty fast so dont forget to get a back cover for it although lenovo provide a transparent plastic back cover but its better if you go for another option
i am not setisfide with this mobile k8 note set becouse i am facing heating probelom during charging and camera quality is very poor  betry drain very fast and terbo charging is not found it take more time during charging

best phn in day price
this is actually too soon to give an detailed review so in a sentencea budget phone which is good in the price range lags in speedsreasonable camerabut ticks all the boxes
unable to hot spot connection to p c via wifi connector
overall a good phone in this price rangethe faults which i came across are ‚Ä¢the phone takes a lot of time for deleting the camera captured images‚Ä¢very poor flash lightfeels like a dim halogen flash bulb‚Ä¢major problem faced is the heating while playing high graphics games and apps and also during the charging‚Ä¢only two colour options available‚Ä¢depth enabled effect is not that up to the markbut its a okay type thing‚Ä¢battery backup isnt that good as i thought
poor batterydont buy
classic phone no issue 
rear camera is not powerful at this price and rear flash is yellowis not comfortable
i want bill of this mobile in my mail by 23 of april 2017
lenovo k8 note is the worst mobile that i bought till now  the battery is very poor even the charger is not good it take 7 hr to charge upto 90 and drains in 1 hr dont buy this mobile it waste of money

i have purchased this lenovi k8 note just few days back and came to know its 3 major drawbacks1 no option for automatic network selection if we enabled 4g3g than it will search and connect with 4g3g network and its not necessary that selected network is available everywhere2 no in built call recorder and only one app on google play store with limited feature for call recording option3 as usual heating problemi just want to return this mobile set
not good product dont buy this phone this phone heating and camera problems etc
i have a complain about this product its not charging the way it used to before the charger given was turbo charger but its charging like a normal phone its taking more than 2 hours to charge properly and the battery gets drain too fast please please please help me with this issue
the lenovo k8 note is good product in this price range k8 note is better device compare to the other the bit disappointing is hitting issue because of decacore processor device hitted and battery should be more than 4000 mah
network not working properly compared to all other mobile phone battery draining too fast camera is ok even turbocharger also not so fast please return my money i feel cheatedalso heating
all over good conditionbt camera not good
battery backup is not goodturbo charging is not workingits take 34 hours is 100 charging
fetures is good and processing speed also well but battery is low finally not bad
battery is not so good as i expected if u continue use internet and games media battery will dry in 4 to 5 daysdisplay is smoothspeed performancevery low heating effect for game like asphalt which is goodcamera is avrge not good but also not bad4day review

most annoying with this phone is get heated up quickly the other thing is the phone get jammed with call connection i have check with other mobiles for same network provider and found that the call get jammed while connect the call this mobile is certainly not a killer notehope this information helps
best in features but battery drains very fast
very bad product battery are draining too fast
battery is draining very fast otherwise nice phone
excellent product
good and very nice
this phone is too heavy and feels like a rock in my jeans and 185 gms is actually quite heavy and is uncomfortable to hold that depth mode in camera which they advertised is a joke and a gimmick dont buy this phone for camera 5 mins of pokemon go and this device feels like im holding a hot pan and 5 mins of listening to music also starts to heat up the device you may think that this phone has 10 core processors so its heats up but why the hell would a phone heat up while listening to music and using camera i have used many phones but i have never seen heating like this before the top part of the back and the screen becomes very hot the game lags when the device becomes hot and the battery starts to drain very fast i used playing wifi and not 4g and im sure the device would become more hot while using 4g i had to shut down the phone to cool it down the ram management is very poor and sometimes apps will reload while heavy multi tasking lenovo may fix these problems with software updates but lenovo is famously known for not pushing updates to any of its phone i asked the customer care of lenovo if theyll push any updates but they had no information regarding this matter in my opinion its better you skip this phone and pay rs2000 extra for the moto g5s plusi requested amazon to retun the product and they said to use the smartcheck app which showed a temperature of about 44 degrees celsius amazon listened to the problem and they promptly sent a technician to my home and he frankly said to return the device as in a period of 6 months or so this device would cause more problems and i did return this phone thanks to an amazon agent i got a refund instead of a replacement of this device which is against their policy
bad product my charger has stopped working within 2 months
product is very nice but its processor is not renowned  it can cause slow functioning in the future
worst phone i ever seen and i am completely disappointed with amazon dont ever buy this phone
this is my fourth smartphone i m using its just fully loaded one all the features which im accepting what a great smartphone
nice one to have  but one of the speaker isnt working
touch screen not working
not so gud
please dont buy bakwas phone
good mobile
screen showing double icons right out of box and is froze 2 times  and i have not yet inserted my sim yet  quality not at all upto expectationswas supposed to be a gift too bad gotta return check the images 
network are not working
it gets heat very frequently contacts gets mixed with other contacts or gets only one contact number saved complex application
nice screen long battery life
best phone at this price range
battery drainage rate is too fastermuch heating on 4g networkbut camera and its display is awesome
after 1 month its working good hopes in future also work good coss the finger
overall performance of phone is excellent but the dual camera and battery can be improved a lot
i bought this phone on first sale and returnedbecause charging is very poorits discharging in 45 hoursother wise ph is very good
lenovo k8 note useless phone doesnt have cast feature such a important option  please dont get mad for this phone there are so many better phones in the market better opt for thatthis is the absolute cheating from the company like lenovo
dont download any app which is more than a gb good phone
nice product
its such a amazing handset in its range fsb performance nice battery back up
let me start with the cons firstcons 1 gps tracking is incorrect if you use any activity tracking app for running walking etc then get ready to see incorrect readings2 dual camera setup is a total gimmick feature though primary 13mp is good3 the front camera has some filter mode enabled by default which produces grainy pics pro cam mode is better4 phone heats up sometimes unnecessarily though not a big con5 headphoneearphone volume output less6 dolby atmos is a big failure it actually lowers the sound output7 no backlit illuminated navigation buttons gets tough in darkpro1 excellent power output2 sound output good3 good voice clarity4 all features rather than the cons work perfectlyverdictfine for the price it is offered for but the phone doesnt live up to the mark as compared to the publicitymarketing lenovo did for this product isnt
1battery is problem it is draining just in4 hours if u brosing internet2sometime all apps are automatically removed from ram3camera is not at all good very poor quality in artificial light and bad indoor both back and front4heating is major issueonly in 10 min of youtube it will get heated
the dual camera setup dont work properly and batter is giving me a backup of 6hrs only very poor phone dont buy this
i am repent afrer buy lenovo product cause many problems1 is call recorder not working2 screen cast not working3 if screen off application install then finger print sancer not workingmamy problem facei will not suggest anyone to buy lenovo product
phone gets heat and very slow charging
look wise phone is good touch is good but when constant 23 hours of internet using phone temp is increase 2nd bad things is camera quality is bad comparison with other dual camera phone like midolby facility is good
battery back hours up not maintained as per your battery condition
back camera not good
very good productno any problem as of now
mobile is gud but charging problem
its too good at the price
awesome mobile
the piece is good looking  elegant  the short comings are no screen shot feature signal reception is not up to mark compared to k3 note it is way behind in internet running
its just okbattry is not good at all
i pay from visa card for ur scheme 10 cash back but not reverse it
please suggest me name of call recording app in which both side of voice can be recorded clearly
the phone had problems like led light not working camera was blurred and no 4g speed in the second sim have visited the service center but it was unsatisafactory
superb phone with amazing looks  many cons toothis phone comes with good camera good backup  good features as android n is loadedthe major pro of this phone is that u dont need induction heater if u have purchased this phoneit heats up very fast and its heating effect last for at least two to three hours so if u do wanna cook u may make omlets on itand its charging is also not that speed as mentioned in its catalog turbo
do not buy lenovo k8 note not having inbuilt call recordingnon clarity sound speakerthe high speed charger unit faulty after first rechargeonly buy lenovo k4 note i expected all features of k4 note in k8 note but not found anything battery discharge as a normal capacity mobile 4000mah not showing performance
no extra features like mi note 4while placing order its written there a headset ll be given but no head set provided its heating very much while charging best to buy mi note 4 instead of it
i am very happy purchasing this shoes
delivered me fast from amazon mobile become heat when charging
awesome phone in terms of processing and camera quality this is the first time i could experience android phone having no lags while playing games the only problem i could find is the phone charges for a long time even though it came with a turbo charger
best product
worth buying for the price1 nice vibrant display and smooth stock android ui2 performance is smooth without any lag issues the phone doesnt heat up during normal usage but with heavy gaming it tends to become quite warmbut still playable and might be a concern for you if youre an avid gamer3sound is ok nothing special as theres just one functional speaker on the bottom right left ones just for show4 some features such as screen mirroring and call recordin phone app optionsusually included in lenovo phones are missing but may be used with third party apps5 both front and back cameras are decent enough for me but the depth effectdual camera doesnt work that well6overall look is stylish and build quality is decent doesnt feel too heavy to hold and feels sturdy7 battery life is ok you can get 1011 hours of continuous usagemore time for normal everyday use
nice product

this is the worst phone i ever used i bought this phone and after 2 days its camera start disturbing after 2 days its both camera and flash light stop working camera quality is not upto the mark as we can expect from dual camera sound quality is good  looks and functionality good battery backup is also not good as you can expect from 4000mah phone then i thought that might be some technical problem so i order the replacementhere the amazon role come they did the fantastic role they plan the pick up from my home as per my request and also arrange the replacement hear i got my replacement order after 1012 days little late but noproblem i was quite satisfied with amazon servicebut again problem come after 23 days in phone a red line start showing between the screen in new phone a new surprise for me i am not satisfied at all with this phone but very happy with the service by amazon now i am returning this phone and suggesting you to choose any other phone next choice is yours
first of all i want to thank lenovo and amazon who made me so good a productbecause this is stock android it runs along and lenovo k8 note are not warm even after playing hoursno any problem playing games connectivity so good together this phone will give 85 out of 10 ratings
awesome phone but it have heating issue otherwise perfect
very poor performance heating problems not working hotspot properly
mobile is good bt battery backup poor and network problem too
prodect and delivery is too good
request for invoice for lenovo k4 note
other than camera i dont find anything good some features i m using in k4 r missing
best phone ever
a decent phone for this price range extremely fast while browsing and when multiple windows are open decent front camera rear camera reasonably ok for the price phones gets heated up while charging but it cools down immediately once the charging is over it takes 2 hours for full charging little over weight still design is handy and loving no hanging or heating issues while using battery last for more than a day with good usage of 4g dolby atmos feature is really cool overall a good budget phone from lenovo
so far so good my priorities were internal memory ram and battery back up other features are similar to phones in this price range there is a finger print sensorphone lock mechanism which is great the camera could have better in low light in all good purchase given the price amazon delivery was on time as well
it does not has volte support battery drains fast
when it was slightly fell down the screen glass corner broken in product specification it is informed that it is cornered with gorilla glass type 3 protection i think product specification is fake
price worthy
please dont buy this motherboard gone in three month of use
heating issue and hung issue after 4 monththis is bundle phone dont buy guys
hang switch off phone
product is good battery turbo charge is really good camera clarity is greatbut only has one issue heating problemrest all is good
very bad mobile battery lifeits battery back up rarely 23 hours maximum
worst camera  ui i didnt expect this type of quality from lenovoand one star  for amazon courier service placed order on 25th aug and received on 1 sep there is no value for prime membership except prime videos
battery is the worst ever and everyone knows about the heating issue

phone is too bad camera cheap quailtybattery backup is good please dont buy online my earphones missing
nice mobile
battery draining very quickly and heating issue too
its really very nice to use i gave 4 stars becoz it doesnt contains some small features which is available in k4 note itself 
nice phone
not up to the mark but camera is good
poor camera performance heating problem battery drains very fast disappointed with the product used k3 note k4 note k5 note k6 power but this one is below them
good mobile with all facilities within a medium budget
very poor network performance network keep on fluctuating ranging 050always gives not reachable message to caller
this phone have some absent featuresmaybe music or video player the phone will heat up sometime
patheticthere are no basic featureslike call or voice recordingsunable to get full tempered glass there are no tools folder availablewant to return asap
rear camera is only one is working i bought this to have dual camera if i close 2nd camera and take photos no changeturbo charger is not fast rather very slow
earphone not attached with phone
not very satisfied with it it just capture some good images apart that nothing is good in this phonesometimes lags too much msgs just gone disppear for while sometimes doesnt show the contact name sometimes doesnt open the required appbefore this phone i was using lenovo p2 i thought lenovo has upgraded this phn with some extraordinary apps but this phone dissapointed me
its good  feeling pleasant performances
good mobile phone but camera is not good
not enough battery
the phone has good features on paper even performance is fine the thing is the back camera lens is very weak it just got broken after 3 weeks of use the mishap is happened unknowingly since my phone didnt fall but i accept the fact that it might have happened due to keys maybe service center quoted 2650 rupees for replace only back panel and yet the back panel is not available in service center they are gonna order it from somewhere so the guy has to keep my phone for 2 days to complete procedure from his end then they will return my phone and after 15 days the back panel will arrive so again i need to hit their door so now in two days i am afraid that they shouldnt stole any spare parts
ram wise good but cam quality is not so good
network problem
this is best smartphone at this price im very happy to bought this phone i personally strong recommend to any other just go for it
battery is very poor quality its 4000mah battery but draining very fast camera quality also very poor

long battery selfie flash nicely designedgriped
blue tooth and wifi problem that its manufacturing or design faultother things are good
nice phone very nice features like ti a lot
very good productperformance is very goodi love this mobile
i buy lenovo k8 note its good  but nfc was miss if its was added its great no other smartphone thank you amazon
battery standing only for 8 hrshow can clear this problem
worst back camera clarity
product is very goodbut feels that phone geeting hot sometimes as this is still not one month old this should not happen lets see if company can review this issue
everything is good as expected except the play back volume which is too low especially when connected to external speakers camera stands at average
so this mobile is good but while playing the games the display is fluctuating 
good
best product of lenovo
phone is much faster and good
good
i didnt get second turbo charger in box 
overall its good but battery backup is issue it gives 12 hr backup rest is good
best in this price
heating is only aproblem
it has very good performance at work without complain it is very chief to compare any other mobile
really pissed off with the product this is the first product i bought from amazon not even 2 months the phone is switching off automatically not responding at tyms apps suddenly stops working etc bought mobiles from flipkart earlier still no issues working perfectly fine extremely disheartening with the product delivered by amazon
phone is lagging frequently
very very poor product moved from moto to lenovo for first time and surely this will be the last time the specs are just highlighted but the phone is half as good as the phones with lower specs very disappointing
the phone was working great until it was running on android 8 lenovo published an update from android 8 to 9 after the update the phone is near to useless i have to full charge it 3 times in a day the battery is draining too quickly and the turbo charger has stopped working due to heavy cpu usage after the update the phone is always heating i upgraded the os in may and started getting the issues i went to service center and they presented with only one solution that is to wait until a software update arrives it has been two months and i have still not received any updateif you are planning to buy this phone then please refrain from upgrading it to oreo otherwise this phone is good
i got this product from amazon but unfortunately the charger is not working i wish if it can be replaced
im still using a lenovo k5 note i find audio speakers better than this k8 noteonly on this basis im not fully satisfied with this k8 noteon the other hand k8 note is really a killer phone as they said at this price point its really a best buy 4gigs of ram n 64gigs of internal dedicated and card slot that means you can use 2 sims n sd card both thats what i like about this k8 noteover all its a best buybut im not fully satisfied with the audio quality as of k5 notes speakers we can really feel the real bass in some heavy bass songsanyway thanks lenovo ¬Æ for this amazing phonei ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è lenovo ¬Æ

this phone really is a killer it will kill you with frustration1constant heating during game playcall or video2 battery drains very fast even handsets with 3000mah battery lasts longer than this phone3 picture quality gets lower in depth mode4 networks goes to no service mode very frequently once the network is gone the only way to get connected is to restart5 signal strength is less compared with other device at the same place6 during the low battery the performance is really slow a normal news app opens up 23 sec after tapping7 charging is really slow charges only 3040 in an hour
super
no connectivity with miracast or any other casting device other than chromecast no icon notification for unread messages  mails no downloading of pdf attachment as it says theres virus and many more issues i dont know who will take care of of these
phone restart again and again

i am big lenovo fan but this phone has put its reputation down serious heating issues and no solutions i wont recommend
very good
i purchased this phone on 20 march 2018 i was hoping to that it would be killer phone it has quite good specifications too but i can say this is feature less phone
superb phone and i am enjoying it
phone works great sound is good camera works great but takes time sometimes to autofocus fingerprint sensor works fine and battery backup is up to the mark  great phone in this range asphalt 8 mortal combat 5  dead trigger 2 works without any single lag till date gaming performance to battery consumption is quute good dwpth mode needs to be a bit better but its acceptable at this range
the worst phone in the world
i was expected good soundbecause i love listening but it disappointed meearphone sound worst
verry bade battry power
this phone is having hanging issues since 2nd day of its use unable to restart and it gets warm even watching videos and turbo charging is not working properly battery gets low quickly very very disappointed by this phone pls dont buy this phone worst experience ever
best phone in this range love it
dont buy this cell phoneno inbuilt call recording even third party app is not supportedno i built voice recorderscreen remained blacked out even when u pushed it away from earworst product by lenovo

vest
nice phoneselfie expert
awesome
very good productdelivered quickly
camera is worst and this vendor give worst quality product
not great bt its quite ok  you have a better option on this price
depth mode is a crap takes almost 2 mins to boot up speaker quality is poor than k5 note battery doesnt retain as 4000mah
good feel
phone is good but if you are unlucky as i was as the screen of my phone was broken due to which i had to visit there service centre in delhi  then you are in big sitfirst of all they dont have screen in there stock  on top of that they are asking exorbitant 7500 rs for screen change for a mobile phone which is only 14000 rsi will suggest everybody that if you are buying lenovo products specially mobile then buy with your own risk  once you brought their product they are least bothered about their customers
amazingly fast delivery about the phone it is one of the best among the 15000 price range and provide best feature s in the category
amazon and lenovo is cheating customers only one sim support 4 g network i am using airtel and jio sim when i use airtel for data then jio sim lost his network because it support only 4g
okp
processing realy fast enough but nothing like turbo charging charging slow  battery backup poor cast screen not working at all

wonderful mobile with unique features
battery performance quality is poor
mobile so bundlebattery problemscharging problem
many problems connecting problems is the most
not user friendly this lenovo k8 note finding very difficult to access any good networks it hangs even to connect to voice calls or browsing any preloaded apps eg  google storei have used several branded mobiles  though it has 4g ram but its processing is very slow compare to any other mobile having 1g ram which i have experienced  not happy in overall  before purching this model i assumed this was good set  i request the manufacturer to look into this matter seriously to solve issueseven dueal camera results not upto the marksee below some of the photos taken from this mobile both dueal camera normal and depth photo shots
camera problem alarm no sound ring tone sum time no sound
worth to rate process very nice
mobile is very slowwhile charging it gets to hoti request to replace by new one already one serviced
it is not updating  
good for the cost
this product is very bad
damn second camera is not working n battery backup is bad advertisement was awesome but the product was not up to the expectation it feels so disappointed
not up to the mark and even if i want to return with in time ama on foes not permit it refers to technical centre which checks the product and says product is ok and you can not do anything further the photos taken give a blue tinge
pure chinese lookdoesnt seems premium at alljust a phone to highlight the featuresbut actually its not giving any thing
excellent performance it is nice ph

problem  1 dual nano sim with dualstandby 4g4g only single sim 4g network support  dual 4g sim not work  2 both camera performance is very very bad 3 battery not turbo charg  sound issue
phone is not working properly
not properly working henge ho raha h bakwas product
screen cast doesnt work with smart tv it works only with chromecast too badthis is because its stock android
lenovo k8 note performance is goodcamera perfect but battery is very badthe low quality gorilla glass protection
the phone is good battery is long lasting charges fast gives good performance the phone heats a little while charging and the dual camera is of no use normal photos are good but the depth effect is very bad so if you want potrait mode dont go for this phone however if you dont care about potrait mode and need a normal camera this phone is great
it is mentioned on website that box will contain headset along with charger but headset is missing
motherboard get damaged in four months
second sim slot not detecting always happens with all type of sim
ok so far so good
i strongly recommend that do not buy this phone it has issue of bettery draining and charging it gets to much time to charge
the transparent back case was fully scratched one

really a gud mobilebut battery drain when mobile is idle over all its gud and affordable price also
the phone is very good its the best phone to buy under 15000
good product battery packup is osm 4000mh and fast processing great gaming smoother experience camera is really good for sellfies one of the best mob for photography
4g network not working and network also fluctuate during data is on
average
beat thing is fast charge and good battery life everything else is average reception quality poor
seal was not broken though it looked like someone has tried to open itback cover was scratchedthe battery was completely discharged which should not be the casethere were two alarms already saved in the phone as if someone else was trying to use the phone
pros1 fantastic display and colour reproduction2 design and build quality3 above average secondary camera with selfie flash4 good ram management5 no heating issues felt till datecons1 mediocre primary camera2 dedicated music button stopped working unexpectedly after the first day
worst battery ever seen in my life 20 drops in single night where mobile is not even touched
good
value for money
i got only 13 mp back camera no 5 plus camera
earphones were not found in the package
i was cheated purchase  13999flipcart rate was 10999
very very worst
dont buy this phone it has battery draining and volte issuesinstead buy a redmi phone
one star is deducted because some features were not friendly like back button is at left side which is bit difficult to use for right hander
there are so many common android fetures are missing wifi strength metre data download speed metre missing alarm not ringing in power off mode there is nothing like tirbo charging it takes 2 hour 45 minutes to full charge while charging in off mode it will not show pecentage done wide touch option not there in pull down menu so many shortcuts are missingdont buy itaverage phone you will became fool
it came as new piece  but i had to reset again because all my files which i had transferred were there but not displaying means phone came as manufacturer defect after reset it was working but lost all my data battery is ok for a day  camera is good play pause button should be assigned only for one purpose only overall average to good phone
its a great phone i liked very much
in this mobile there is no auto call recording option third party apps also not recordingonly recording our voicenot able to recording others voice other wise all specs are good
everything is finebut showing low network signals and little hot on charging
satisfying smartphone
good smartphone for lower medium budget is average in all departments dual camera setup is just a gimmick and not at all useful but the normal and front camera is decent contains all sensors and nothing is skipped only thing is that lenovo is bad with update pushes but till now has provided support good for normal daily usages like surfing video calls social networking etc
good
nice onevery satisfied
i bought a lenovo k8 venom black model just one day before i have started using it but im not satisfied with the delivered product im facing few issues like when the device gets locked automaticallyim unable to unlock it using power key since its a new product i would expect a quality substance but that was not there in my case i request you to look into the issue to take back the device  provide a better solution
good
i bought a phone at 12000 but this mobile is not work
bad product
many options are less network problem
ok goodi am not recived cash back
1 star cut for bukeh mood
worst expierence in my life
heavy haeted and no charging
heavy in wieghtcameramusic are goodbut look is average
this mobile is üî• heating too much double camera quality is not good front camera is good for selfie loveri think it name should be k8 üî• fire  becoz it gives u nothing but heat sombody plzzzz help me to resolve this issueand friend i suggest youhonor 6x is far better than this heating element
just network problem i will face on sim one slate
mobile is undoubtedly best in its sector but unfortunately my mobile front camera has stopped working due to which i am not fully satisfied and convinced about buying a product from online stores the company is requested to kindly get my mobile replaced
third class camera lenovo fools banavo mat
bogas
which is better honor 6x or lenovo k8 note
phone is superb but somewhere i found heating issuesspecially while chargingand also the dual rear camera combination is not so specialfront is goodelse everything is excellent
good
very bad item so many heating problem depth are not like dslr so many problems in this phone
dont buy its heating and battery fast draining fix this pleased
too much heating u can actually iron your shirt so much heat is produced and apps not responding properly i would give a negative rating if it was been there
other than camera nothing it has goodneither it has any latest advanced feature added in its system softwarefor each basic purpose you need to install a separate app like app lockalso dont have basic features like reading mode other advanced settings i have complain with your phone body design  software system i think it looks like older model also its softwareno improvement
most bad technologies phone in world1st thing its heated more and more with normal useno games no wifiif use wifi then it heated very muchdont buy this phonei want to sell my phone on 6kused 6mnth
friends dont go for lenova k8 note its totally waste of moneybcoz with 15 days of usage experience its waste 
liked it
awesomeness
no call recording possible call records only for last 3 callsbakwaas phone
set is ok but since i used lenovo k3 note i think features are more with lenovo k3 note and quality of camera much better with k3 note compare to k8 note phone call recording system also not available with k8 note which was very much there with k3 note
please dont buy this product battery is over heating like anythingand overall i will give rating of 2 onlyyou will get good smartphone if you add 3000 extrapls go for thatalso dont ever buy phone from amazon since you cannot return the product if its damaged or not workingi am a victimthey will ask to download an app and then after getting through some steps finally they will tell you that your phone is working properly
this one is the best photo in this range i am happy with this photo thanks
as shown in ad its not a killer cameras are not up to the mark only two things are great one is touch pad and finger sensor all major applications are belongs to google only lenovo doesnt own any app not any music player themes wallpaper not even set our own ringtone
very good phone
lenovo k8 note does not have screen mirroring option you cannot connect to your smart tvbut that option is available in k4 note and k5 note and in many lenovo modelsadvance model means extra features should get added not removing the existing features
worth to buy but the screen have low resistance
good
battery got heat wanna to change what the procedure
if there could be 0 star i will give thatbattery is discharging very rapidly as if it is of 500 mah battery
good
best smartphone

its good to have all new features in this but the battery backup was not very goodand heating very quickly and remaining all are very nice
lenovo have launched this handset with several features but all are waste the phone will start heating hanging charging issue network issue after 4 months itself i loved lenovo k3 note and thats why purchased it due to feature like dual rear camera  deca processor totally waste to buy never ever go for it even the service is also too baddont update to oreo the handset is dead

i have purchased this phone in first time in amozen but very bad experience i received defective charger but no body help me

prosgood mobilegood performancegood packing and deliverypersonally i like this mobilecamera and sound clarity is goodcons1 mobile heating up while charging2 display edges are curved so air bubbles are there on tempered glass edges3 i took venom black flet something is missing in appearancecant pin point better go for white4 if u r buyingbetter buy its accessories like pouch tempered glass or scratch guardu cant find these items in local store5 no earphone with this set6 most important mobile is heated up by prolonged use of wifi
dont buy this
it is not giving proper network maximum time mobile hang while talking battery does not work for a long time
poor gorilla glass 3 its easy damaged in my pocket and when i asked to them so they said they are not responsible for damage so why the addverties that product is very good and have good qualitiesraj mishra7383506358

when it get updated to oreo it get heated and start some unwanted activities
overall its a good productvery handybattery backup very good with turbochargercamera averagenice fingerprint scanneroverall its a best device under 15k
when there will be a new update for this phone because the phone rear camera depth mode is not nice and the phone is getting heat and the battery life is not nice
average phone dual camera and depth mode are over rated not that goodgo for moto though its owned by lenovo itself still the performance is better
received the defective piece
mobile is good but heting problem with drain fast discharge battery battery back up problem
after oreo update phone has battery draining fastcan turn off mobile data
no heating issues found product received in two days time mobile performance is fantastic turbo charging is good charged my phone battery from 24 to 100 in 1hr 10mins time will definitely recommend this product but if you can spend 3k bugs extra moto g5s plus will be a better option
screen is very weak it is not gorilla glass so be careful when buying it
phone getting charging 6 hr for 60  getting heat  and i think it is not new mobile i want replacement because its is old mobile it doesnt have atleast transparent pouch
heating issue it heat alot and might this issue lead it to blast  might hurt any one or urself will not recommended it even i return it also camara quality is not upto the mark
in 1 month i have issue with unlocking key pad is missing so no pin can be entered still figuring how to rectify this issue
please do not buy this phoneworst phone ever seen selfie camera totally mirror reflection type reverse words in photo and battery is 4000mah fast charging 2 hours more than over heating 23 battery stand back dual camera is very bad depth camera not and dolby speakers not working properly and phone refurbished lenovo zuk 2 
excellent
i m totally dissatisfied and disapointed as i didnt expect this kind of phone i have purchased this mobile on 25817 and after some days only i felt that i m being cheated as there are no features of smart phones  smart features in call history are completely missingphone doesnt allow me to do a conferene callat the bottom there are shown dual speakers but one sided speakers are fully dead just like a show piece there is a 4 gb ram specification but for the daily use apps counted only 3 named watsapp hike  true caller it consumes average of 3 gb ram so it is only a fool making optionhated lenovo mobiles from this purchase onwards feeling cheated
good
paradoxically great phone but some features like power  power manager  and shortcuts for silencing the phone and others are not there  which we can use very often
goodits working smoothlyand also thanks to amazon to deliver it within time
very worst product charging slot is not working it hardly takes charging i am unable to charge my phone
its a bad mobile camera and sound quality is very poor
the product is good but but the phone is heating if talk 2025 minutes and amazon delivery is very bad
good mobile k8 note very fast charge with turbo power is given but sim number is not show and not save any number in sim card because stock android is given
camera not satisfied
nice phone but kuch missing hai
battery back up is killer camera is just too good bokeh mode is very good quiet effectiveslow motion video is also quiet great to capturedolby is amazing looks also super venom blackcharging if it could have been made a lil quicker but no complaints
very good in this price
best modal for lenovo
great
good built
i am not totally satisfied
just average
awesome phone  battery backup is very nice camera is also gud and sound system is better because of dolby atmos
where the hell is super power saver feature like k3 note phone
brought this on great indian sale sound quality is worst have to volume up min 5 times for the sound to raise to 1 point and max sound is very lessdolby does not have any effect as compared to other lenovo mobilesscreen brightness is very poor 
dont buy this this mobile automatically switches off when battery charges full
battery 3rd classnumber 1 hang mobilemobile heating highly
battery is not working 12 haour and camera results is evrage
nice product
good one
this phone is really awesome and super cool  i have been using for a month and its performance is excellent
betternot bad
battery back up is not up to the mark getting too much heating the rest are good bugs to be automatically fixed
superb camera battery and performance
it is a very nice phone
worst mobile i have ever purchased
overall a good phone but battery backup is not good and phone must have different colours for led light for different notifications
super awesome  it performs very much better than the replaced one  no heating problem during calls battery draining is quite relevant everything is ok but lenovo should have provided an earphone admirable camera calrity and best selfie phone worth buying for this cost 
this is absolutely amazing cell
worst product returning backdisplay flickeringhorizontal lines fluctuating on keypad
very good
the cons are as follows1battery does not last more than 8 hours with typical usage a toy in front of redmi note 42 terrible performance of both front and rear camera in low and transient lighting condition focussing barely happens even if it does it takes 23 seconds and get lost3 depth mode is a joke it blurrs the hair if you try to focus on the face
awsome product by lenovoexcellent competition in market
very bad phone the user interface is so bad waht to tell and worst part amazon wont takenit back purchaseing a phone from amazon is a trap plz dnt
not worth full
the system update is too bad everyday there will be new software to update and everytime i update my phone gets slowerthe battery is draining fast and charge takes timethe phone switches off itself sometimesit takes 4 to 5 minute to switch on
nice phone so fast and hassall free
perfect 
battery is not up to its capacity

flipkart is giving at rs11000

after 5 days from i bought itit works good everything is perfect
ok
camera and battery are not upto the marked remaining every thing is perfectheating issue is there but i assume due to its deca core processors and aluminium body its been little warmbut battery is an big issueneed optimization i believe lenovo will surely release and ota update to enhance the performance
simply great
awesome phone great looks great battery backup turbo changing is so gud it charge 100 battery in 80 min onlycamera  dollby automus audio is also gudvalue for money phone
good phone
just feeling top of the world
product is goodwe need to inset the headphone in mobile jack until we hear a tip sound else we might be under the impression that headphone is not compatible with mobilejblsamsung headphone suits with thislenovo k8 noteits a great mobile for the prize range
notification problem left side speaker problemapp hanged otherthan this this phone is good
very good in performance sound  picture quality
note true note
good product worth for the money

good phone thankyou amazone
voice issue found and go to lenovo care to solve at 1st day 
nice phone pls pls pls go for lenovoall camera n specifications  all r best performance also look so better 
it is better
very poor performancemany times reboot automatically in a dayservices and apps are auto stopped
update from the past few days my k8 note is taking more than 8 hours to charge i am using the original charger that shipped with this phone the turbo charging has stopped lenovo will ask to carry it to their service center too frustratingthe phone is fast due to the ram and processor however none of the lenovo phones have a good camera i wish i had again bought the honor6x which i use for myself as the lenovo was a gift to someone i bought it considering the dual camera feature but this is nowhere close to the camera quality that honor 6x provides the photos are not clear and are grainy the camera app does not have filter modes like nightmode beauty mode slow motion for video however the phone is not bulky and has a gorilla glass the back cover is a good addon the battery optimisation feature is not that effective badge count for apps whatsapp unread count on icon is not available navigation keys are not illuminatedi would advice honor6x in case people are looking for a quality camera phone the pro model is also good if people are willing to shell out more
it is a pathetic phone
poor display battery draining fast and heats up too much while chargingand looks ordinaryfast fp scanner and processor
item not so good as i expected charge drains fast  not seems like charged with turbo charging model is not so good but sound quality is best ive ever seen in a phone finger print sensor is best too angry that not contain earphone in the box
camera quality is very bad batery performance is quite disappointed no led notification for miss calls
bed üîã backup front camera quality is poor in nightoverall average rated mobile
very soon heating problem dont ever never buy this for more details feel free to call me on 9852865839
unsatisfied with lenovo k8 note 64 battery consumption is high can be drained in less than 6 hrs with continuous working on phone turbo charge is not right as you said in just minutes it take one and half hour to get charged rear camera is very bad at night  screen resolution is pale

phone reviewappearance 45 phone is good looking and hold is good i personally preferred black though gold is goodperformance  35 i am not sure why lenovo doesnt used spandragon 635 processors used by lenovo is ok its fast but not consistent legs come and app crashes but memory management is goodscreen  35 it is highly recommended to use screenguard scratches can from key and coinscamera  25 duel back camera of the phone is not so great you were not able to find refined depth effects some time you find originality is missing but it is good in sunlight with larg area cover45 front is best for this budget range pics are quite clear ans crispverdict  phone is good for average use but if you are looking for something extra this shouldnt be the choice for you
one of the worst products after updating android o suggested by lenovo i am not able to use this product now i am not bothered about this i am just bothered that i am losing all my data

review after using the phone for 6 month one of the worst product of lenovo i guess lenovo itself has become worst now4 gb ram  never felt like using 4 gb no ram management phone slowed down in 6 monthscreen  all lenovo phone has screen issues pale yellow mark automatically comes and screen wil be non responsive from that partcamera  worst camera even seen even a 2000 rs phone might have better camcustomer carre support  worst everbuy lenovo phones to waste your money if you want a good phone with the speccs declared as in ad then go for any brand but not for lenovomy phone is in warrantee called multiple times but they dont bother abbt helping you they just asked me to put my phone with lenovo support it will be with them till they find any issues else thry will return it in a month or so  a month for finding issue in phoneplanning to throw the phone soon and bye bye to lenovo for ever
battery is not satisfied with its backupon my full charge at 6am it exhausts around 2 pm
battery backup poorfeatures are goodfront cam goodrear cam poorsametimes hanging problemlooking also goodoverall satisfactory product

used this mobile for 7 days flawless performancefor a normal user it last more than a day both camera is doing great in daylight but average in low light conditiongps is very bad not accurate battery is draining even when phone is not used camera in depth mode is not gooddisplay is good there is no lag during gaming

very worst product very worst customer service
very good performance budgeted phone
all ok but display quality not good average
good qualities lenovo k8 note phonei like u
its just an amazing phoneit has only one cons i eit gets warm up quicklybut an ama phone
i had purchased this mobile and returned on next day after observing the reviews from other users on amazon let me brief you on the details1 i liked this phone from the day when i saw its ad on amazon look and feature were awesome2 camera great front is also great3 no need to doubt on sound there is dolby atmos which is a plus point of the phone4 on first time charging and video playing and games it gets warmed a bit but thats too because i was suspecting as mentioned on reviews its a normal heat nothing you can say as a negative point5 no lagging6 only concerns area battery draining is not usual without use also charging gets decrease for example in 4 hours after a full charge got discharge up to 22 i had played a 5 minutes video and played 2 games for 5 7 minutes onlymay be this is due to processor as power management is not properb network signal is not showing with full bar however it was not impacting call performance or data performancesometimes there wont be a single bar of network but if you dial a number or try to open googlecall will get connected and signal will appear on phone or google will work without any issueif lenovo fix the problem by updates for battery draining and signal then this is definetly a great buyunfortunately i had to return this phone as there is no solution at presentfinally a great appreciation for amazon representative who did a health check of my phone and initiated a returnnow time to check my account for the refund amountüòã
your product is good quality so thank you
front panel gets too hot with even normal usage its back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage i cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear what is the use of other cool things which we can do with this device if we cant perform the most basic function of calling  without feeling the heat browsing etc the device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a callyes it gets this hot
best phone in best price
i love this phone has everything speakers are not loud and nothing fancy lot of space and memory only thing that was slow was google assistant
lenovo k8 note very good mobilevery good battery backupvery good both camera quality 
waste product dont go with lenovo or someother company only go with xaiomi and samsung phones
nice mobile
recording not available
good phone with good features so far no issues
it was good in process but not good in operating system
its been 20 days since i am using this phone great performance but dont look for this as a camera phone and yes it is bit heavy but thats okay fingerprint works smooth and fast speakers are awesome dolby sound is a plus 4 gb ram makes it super smooth and fastscreen display is perfect with actual colors go for it at rs 12000 discount price time to se how long it lasts
bought for ma dad he loved it
worst thing i have ever got from amazon this was my first order and im really disappointed from this product
good phone but camera not works good in low light also its using 25 mb ram with pre installed apps amazon both offer as idea 343 is cant utilised because idea best offers are not showing it as i have added motorola sports headphone also but its shown at not available in stock at now its cost is 159900 in phone box there is no any headphone  so amazon is making fool in both offers
amazzing phone
good
phone doesnt come with new system updates as claimed in the description i had to download and install 4 system updates even though it was not much of a trouble still thats cheating the customer with wrong claims and is not acceptable review of the product will be put up soon
battery very poor i am very unhappy

i have been using this phone for about 8 months phone is awesome eveythings fine a little bit work om camera nit such good camera over all phone is good
horrible product1st one had network reception problemreplacement had the same along with additional speaker problemkudos to amazon team for assisting in hassle free refund of sum paid
it works like an costliest induction stove when i use more than 15 minutes network signal strength very worst please give money to orphanage or other social networks instead of buying this worst and waste mobile this mobile surely ruins amazons reputation so amazon dont promote this mobile
heating problemhotspot not workingas per price camera is ok dont buy

cons pathetic dual camera heats rapidly no fast charging application crashes heavy weight battery drains fast bad network receptionpros solid body not so good display smooth touch glass
i am satisfied with this product but battery backup is average
its too bad in mobile quality
its a good product but as for frequent software updates
worst services by amazon till date took a replacement of the device but then to the device wont function properly lagging a lot worst battery life would want to give a zero star butt they dont have an option for it
bad battery
awesome
im very happy with the outlook but not the batterybattery drains very quickly and charging also very late turbo charging feature is fully wasteos will consume more n more power than the external app like facebook google maps
i bought the lenovo k8 note on amazon im deeply disappointed by the phones performance the 4000 mah battery surprisingly lasts less than 24 hours even with minimal usage the fingerprint scanner cannot recognize my finger print the wifi feature gets disconnected after a couple of minutes even when the signal is strong ive a feeling darshita electronics the seller has sold me a lemon unfortunately i cannot return the product as i started using after the date by which i could have returned it
nice products
hellothe phone starts resetting itself randomly this issue starts after after 3 days of use especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two the issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days then i tried few option mentioned in lenovo help app which is preinstalledi am feeling like a stupid for having done this  after that for 4 or 5 days it didnt show this issue now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night use the phone in night then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning boom it is dead already and when you manually poweron there is enough juice left in the battery not sure what to do with this kind of issue the phone is absolutely uselesswhen i approached amazon for return they are quoting policy and suggest me that i should run pillar to post to get problem rectified not sure even it is rectifiable issue the below amazons tagline tagline sounds funny earths most customercentric company i am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean i am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in amazon and now i realized that buying lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage
quality not so goodi want to return this item immediatelykindly processed as soon as possible
little bit heat
excellent worth of purchase
totally wastage of moneyeven small features like network speed indicatorrecorder is missingclock hangs at any timehave to restart it again and again

ordered for my cousin and received within 2 days thanks to amazon stock android was the foremost reason to buy this mobile since stock android has benefits of smooth usage relatively less load on cpu and better battery backup but this mobile heats up for normal usage forget gaming its getting very hot for streaming on youtube battery backup isnt good because of over heating camera is just okay practically redmi note 4 is much better and moto g5 plus is recommended
screen mirroring option not availablecannot cast mobile screen on smart tvfeature available in phones available with low features and configuration
excellent
please dont buy this k8 note has this serious issue of cellular data suspended after a while the data services on the sim card gets suspended automatically and you have to restart again and again to start using the internet i noted this only after few days and now amazon wont return the product as well i researched about this on the internet and found other users are also facing this issue i am trying to figure out if this issue can be resolved but lenovo as a brand has lost its value and i wont recommend buying any of its phone ever

gud but slightly heats up
good one all features are to the mark specially dolby atmospherebut the only camera is not to the markthis feature should be improvedlenovo company lacks in camera feature
after using phone for 4 months i can conclude that this is the worst phone of the year doesnt capture network when you move from one location to other worst battery camera quality ok no dual 4g right now i have idea 4g in my mobile but its speed is less than 2g of other network no issue of sim card totally disgusting frustrated with the purchase no improvement though recent updates
forget turbo charging in this phone u get turbo discharging feature also u can use it to cook inlets and maggi camera bokeh effect sometimes fades the subject feature like it even faded my beard phone graphics is not good bezels are thick
good
not good1 at a 2 4g sims not working 1 will be on 4g  other then will be in 2g3g2 camera quality also not good back camera 
the worst phone i have ever bought  i bought it on 6th of oct and from 25th oct i started facing issues with the phone  within 3 hours of normal usage like whats app checking of mails and music listening the battery drops down from 100 to 26  the quick charging is crap  it takes 6 hours for my phone to get charged from 26 to 90 typing of this review is taking around 10 minutes as phone is getting hanged continuously  call reception is very poor  at thane station i dont get internet signals i dont use camera or gaming and i feel pity for plight of such users this phone is not capable of normal functions leave the smart fucntions  i feel like throwing this phone due to constant irritation i strongly recommend dont buy this phone as it offers amazing features on paper for cheap price i also fell in the same trap
wtf i bought this last month for 14k464 now all of a sudden 2k has been reduced now its available for 12k never expected this from lenovo no complaints about the device just fine
i didnt like too much this product
good in this range 
apart heating issues phone is great for normal day to day usage
bluetooth is worst battery super
its amazing to see such a phone but camera depth enable sensor is not working smoothly
camera quality not good
slim and beautifulheating problembattery is discharging very sooncall recording feature is not available
value for money
facility wise very good phonebut video and photo quality should be improved lotit will be better to provide amoled screen and additional ram with increased price
good mobile under 12000
awesome phone
dont buy this phone its really a chinese product even if it is giving 4300 mah batrery it works fine for just first 3 months then it actually starts showing its true color its battery sucks like normal phone its not even works for contineous 6 hours try another phone i wasted my 13k on this so its my humble warning
it is very slowly charged and fastly completed
there is no gorilla glass i received the broken screen product is gorilla glass so delicate really its just fake publicity the proximity sensor was not working correctly battery is draining fast it wont last for the dayhardly 78 hours after full chargegot replacement after too much of hard work and calling delivery boy was not taking the product need to call customer care to convince him getting replacement from amazon is a very tedious task flipkart replacements are very easy and no questions askedplzz do not update to oreobattery draining too fastmobile getting so hot that u can iron your shirtoverall not happy with everything
nice
this phone was just osami had ever since features like this
very good product value for money
as it is turbo charger but it takes more then 4 hrs to get charge
battery performance is very poor
superb handset
this phone does not support cast feature which it‚Äôs earlier variant were supporting like k5 notecasting only works with chrome cast for which you spend another 3300 bucksafter oreo update the phone heats up like anything and dries up the batteryafter k5 note i had set my expectations high from lenovo but this phone is a big disappointment
really good camera qualityloved the touch and screen enlagrment really smooth enough space the best part is the dual camera facility at the back and as well as loved everything about this phone dual sim slot along with memory card when received already there was a back cover and screen card on it best phone under 12000 really very much satisfied user of 10 days only
out of 32gb internal memory only 22 gb can be usedalso some heating issue
very bed product
mobile cover is not good 
good product best battery back up and amazing camera quality
mibile is good but back option key is left side is not good and yellow flash is very big problem
the ultimate performer phone with all latest features
nice lookgd battery backup light in wtbtfeeling something missing in android versiongiving old feelingone thing morewhen we share files from one to another deviceit goes slowerthat goes against its processorone thing about delivery processits delivery process is than other competetive sitesit should be delivered before d given timein my opinion

i pay for gift but i couldnt get the gift
super
very bad
getting heating problem
this device gets very hot during charging and net surfing other wise great performance
superb phonemust buy
defective product need refund for this product i cant believe amazon asking me to do troubleshooting for a brand new product with a faulty cam battery and heating problem which is risky
performance is not upto the mark
i bought this phone and within one week the problem begins the battery heats up during charging and wont charge more than 60 in 5 hours i called up customer care and after a thorough examination i could luckily get a refund from amazon so if you think about buying this phone be prepared to waste a couple of days dealing with customer care
it emits a lot of heat cant hold it for longer period in hands and near ear while talking i purchased ear phones and using them as alternativethe screen got scratches when i put it in my pocket along with bike keys before buying i saw bharat nagpal  igyaan video in youtube he showed that the screen wont get scratches even with knife but its wrongmobile lags when playing small game like candy crush forget about playing big gamesbattery is down in less than 5 hours turbo charger is for name sake full battery charging takes 1 hr 30 mins
good phone
good product
asom phone
within a month turbo charger is not working and heating problem
dont buy this product  after 6 month its heating and hanging phone book not working
good
not worth
all basic and important features are missing 1 no soundmutevibrate button 2 no inbuilt call recording 3 no group option in contact manager 4 it is only lte but not volte lenovo is a renouned company but how they made lenovo k8 note without basic features we expect updates on the basic features metioned here
good product
we bad experience with lenovo  after buying phone 3 day mobile fall from chair  display get damage  visit service center where they refused to replace under warranty  even i agree for paid repair they dont have display  how much it will cost  so i pay advance 1k  order display after waiting for one month and several call  visit to service center they put new display which cost 8000  for mobile which i buy for 14000on 29 sept some how i get my mobile back where music button is not working due camera is fup  cant take pictures or do recording no bokeh effect  worst service center in mapsagoa
lenovo made good hand set in this cost and features r good speed is good i really using this mobile it performs is very nice lenovo fullfill every dream of customer
its heat up when you charge the phone or watching movies battery drain fast its support quick charge but if you use wifi then definitely two or more times must be require to charge the phone
2 ringer speaker in phone but one not work when i check after delivery
fake ass company
call recording and video call using time not working front camera light
this phone doesnt meet my expectations after using it for three days i found that this phone is lacking so much responding slow camera quality is not good even after having two rear cameras this phone makes me think as i am using an old phone there are so many bugs in this phone sometimes clock is not showing up the right time overall bad experience i choose this phone over redmi note 4 and i think i made a bad decisio for the first time i purchased lenovo and it is a bad experience the only good thing about this phone is dolby atmos you can get better options to choose from in this price segment
the phone has no wireless display system as such you cant use it with smart tv this is major drawback of the phone
good phone the only two cons are the heating issue while charging and the camera quality not up to the mark
third class phone i will never recommend any body
facing heating issue while playing game and during on going call heating starts after 15 minutes
back camera full dull
very bad supportpoor camera clarityheating problemheadphones not included selfi is no more totally this is not a good product same rate honour 6x is good for us

phone not working as expected i replaced it once but again facing same issue
blutooth not working properly after connecting to speakersits buffering while playing songs after connectingwifi hotspot is not visible in laptopsotherwise a good phone
good mobile avarage camera
hi bought this phone in december the phone features are awesome but theres is bluetooth connectivity issue the same was informed to amazon and the phone was replaced but the replaced phones also has the same issue hence returning the phone
over all its bad phone
the phone is getting heated up on continuous usage for more than 30minutes
have display problem  has develop only after the exhaust of return period
its heat when using with net not worth i dont recommend to by this product
i liked the design and sound quality display its good its heats a bit but its fine due to metal body phone processor is super fast
i purchased the above phone on first sale in amazon no doubt it is a good phone but i dont find anything extraordinary other than deca core separate slots for two sims and sd card and looks the phone gets heated very fast the main drawback i noticed is that lenovo k8 note fails to connect when the mobile data is switched on at that time one is not able to upload or download any audios or videos or pictures except receiving and forwarding chat messages on such occasions one finds a small x at the below right end of the coverage icon of service provider thereafter it was noticed that phone could not detect any nearby device through bluetooth and soon after a few days it was noticed that the phone would not connect to wi fi also therefore the smartphone became almost useless for methus i find that lenovo k8 note is one of the worst device i was forced to return the device and i must appreciate amazon for their prompt response in arranging return pick and also issuing refund on the same day so the only good experience in purchasing the above phone was the amazing service provided by amazon
battery is not powerful enough takes a lot of time to charge phone heats up
call recording is not available  camera quality not good depth sensing worst  but phone is fast not bad but before buying think twice
network problem 4g  sound is not work clarity only one speaker worknot support for amaezon bad experince in amezon
handset is quite good camera  clarity very nice processing is very goodthough the battery capacity is 4000mh its gets drain out in 14 to 18 hours gets heat up some times
phone looking is good but heating is so much and hanging also
great news
battery drain after 7 months of useand now not supported to turbo charging disappointed
lenovo k8 note very bad experience at per value not upto markif you are thinking for this please immediately change the way other wise waste money
it should be supported volte

good speed and performance with ultra fast touch sensor but having some problems like you cant save the new contacts in your sim
on paper seems to be the best i bought it in the first flash sale dual camera doesnt seem to be so promising headphone output very inferior dolby atmos has to be superior but it is inferior to even the low range phones battery too doesnt behave as 4000 mah some software lags the double touch to wake isnt consistant few minute features missing as it is stock android like no vibration when charger connected no battery percentage indicator while charging unimpressed with it in comparison with k4 and k5 note hence returned it giving 2 rating only keeping in view of its features listed on paper lenovo has to do a lot to uplift its performance and service centres too the availability of accessories is also cumbersome though available the price is not similar at all service centres located in the same city after introduction of gst a few service centres are hesitant to give bill and warranty to accessories indicating unprofessional practices from lenovo

best mobile with good configuration at this priceafter using mobile for 2 weeks im writing this review most of the reviews are fake in my opinion lenovo k8 note hasgood cameragood battery lifeno heat issuegood displaysome of drawbacks are slow charging its take more than 1 hour to charge from 30 to 100 percentage another one is no headset with mobile
as the phone heats up a bit to much it has only a single star rating for me
after using the product for three months found following issues1  heats very much2battery drains out very fast3 turbocharging takes a lot of time after an updatewill not recommend this product now earlier i felt this was a good product
nice phone but dont expect much from dual back camera front camera is super

very poor quality battery backuponly write 4000mah battery to attract peoplevery worst productsamsung 3300 mah battery backup much more batter than lenovo k8 note
first of all earphones are not provided with the phones but what about its itnernal features lenovo has done changes that we cannot record the call like in earlier modelsand as per the specifications instead being available on discount the phone is quite costly as compared to other phones present in market with more and great latest features availableand the thing i needed the most call recording is missing i request to send an ugrade for the same as soon as possible rest phone is working fine till now lets see furtherand for amazon atleast keep the return window open for 10 days

so far so good
good product but have no fast charging
not satisfied by this phone not as per expectations heats a lot curtosy mediatek processor battery life isnt great doesnt even last a complete day on average usage keeps draining quickly even on standby  i dont have many power intensive apps not very ergnomic to hold the corners are very sharp camera is okok dual camera depth mode isnt precise while recording videos i have noticed the lens is focusing multiple times and as a result it keeps blurring and focusing giving a poor outcome video when u see the video again later visibility under sunlight is not that great brightness is generally less if u increase brightness means it consumes more power takes a long long time to charge wonder why they call turbo charging i noticed some issue with my handset not sure if its common across lenovo k8 note although there are 2 speakers left ones is very weak the right speaker is strong and loudi wouldnt recommend this phone especially when there are good phones in price bracket moto g5s plus is much better choice  even if it means spending few bucks extra
great phone killer features
before i buy iti thought it would going to heatafter one month of hard usage i didnt get any heat issues and turbo charger is doing greatoverall its a beast
nice feature amazing phone

this is just an average phone with above average specs mentioned in sale documentwhats good screen size is large and good if you like it value for money is goodwhat could have been better or is not that good the camera is below average inspire of having a dual camera the pictures in low light is quite poor the back button is on left side of bottom screen so one hand operation is not easy battery life is good as per specifications but in reality it hardly lasts for complete day with average usage and not more than 10 minutes of game play user interface was better in previous models there is no option to cast the screen to smart tvs like all older models of lenovo this is a big drawback
have battery problem not getting charged  if got charged it gets down in 15 min
nice phone in this price rangeturbo charger takes too much time to charge the battery and heating issues also there

very good productbut fedex delivered this goods too much late

quick battery drain on standby and occasional heating issues dual camera implementation is fine but the overall image quality is average and could have been better

i have bought this phone from this seller during its september launch now within 2 months my device screen started showing some small white lines appearing on screen from top to bottom when viewing or editing certain images or while playing games when i contacted lenovo service center they said its not display issue but its some manufacturing defect so the unit should be replaced by seller now seller wont replace my device as its 2 months old so guys its better to not buy devices online or if you do want to buy check your device thoroughly within 10 days or you wont get replacement especially its lenovo

overall a great product cons are the charging issue is real even though it is a turbo charger apart from that a slight heating issue which is common in most of the phonepros great camera smooth ui no bloatware great camera
phone was good but heating problemi want to purchase lgq6 but lost time i was decided to take lenovo k8
phone is good in its price range camera display response of touch quality are decent main cons you must consider while purchasing this item to decide whether or not they are tolerable are i no ir blaster you cant use this as remote of tv or set top boxii no functioning screen cast option iii few only few bluetooth devices unable to connect
the good device from lenovo loved it
battery drain big let downdual camera is name sakeonly positive is stock android  separate sd card slot  basically phone not worth the price people check other options also in same price range
mobile is ok but for good quality of camera you have to use both the rear cameras and if u use both of them no flash option and there are some heat problem when u use ur mobile for 1hr continuously

pretty disappointing product lenovo was able to generate some sort if hype successfully touting k8 note as a music phone and dual camera phone capable of taking bouquet snaps like dslrs etc infact features were lucrative after 3 months usage really unhappy about the product in fact within a couple of days of receipt i tried to return this piece which amazon didnt accept so buyers better be aware of the 10 days return acceptance claim being put forward by amazon its not a no question asked return policy i accept the phone was not faulty technically hence the customer support person couldnt help me out perhaps even though he agreed to initiate the return procedure prima facie all said and done i am still a loyal customer of amazon only angry with lenovo and on myself why i jumped on to purchase immediately the phone got released shouldnt have done this mistake being a gadgetgeek myself my bad theres really no point in making an attempt to write a product review simply put its a mediocre product apart from the dedicated nano sim slots  dedicated microsd memory card slot nothing is actually likeable only this feature is worthy mentioning as i hate the combined sim  memory tray slots where you need to choose only 2 out of the 3 using redmi note 4 as well and this is something i hate about the otherwise brilliant phone one more observation k8 note was touted and hyped as a stock android phone at least for me the stock os nougat didnt impress me i am using 3 different custom ui layers  miui for xiaomi eui for my le eco max 2 touchwiz in samsung galaxy note 3 and anyday would vote for them for providing with enhanced intelligent usability especially miui and touchwiz have not used oxygenmod myself though apparently it felt quite good i didnt find this stock android in k8 note really fast devoid of any lag etc from the ease of usage perspective i was not at all impressed hence even if the custom uis have some lagslowness and bloatwares thats the tread off i am ready to embrace any day just for the logic and intelligence they provide with
the battery charging is not at all goodit should take 2 hrs 16 mns to charge fully but after a month of using it its taken ng up to 6 hrs to get fully charged
poor battery backup its like 3000 mah lol and average camera dual camera is crap overall is nice
phone was good camera quality good speed also good
lenovo did good job by adopting stock android overall good package in budget smartphone section camera is good  music lovers will love this phone bcz of dac dolby atmos usp of this phone is dual camera on rear with which we can capture sone really good depth mode pics with bookeh effect
great phone
its good
battery consumption jyada hai
superb phone
its a worst mobile that i but tell now its sound quality is very worst its heats up very mush and in very quick manner and its battery low up very quicklyi want to back this worst mobile and i also talk to amazon person some days before and i said i will talk again but i dont get time so amazon help me talk with me in this topic and in last to want say that change the mobile or give me my precious money back

cant believe i got it at 10k great phone but the chip set seems to be bit troublesome which is compensated by deca core processoronly thing that buyers still expect is confirmed updates immediately as they arrive in marketgets heated a bit while chargingcommon inany phones so no need to worryeverything else is just awesome

battery problemcharging problemheating problemand also too poor amazon service
very bad product
the worst camera i have ever seen even my very old configuration mobile phone had a better camera resolution battery draining faster
useless product only hype has been created battery is so poor that drains out in few hrs charging takes 34 hrs though it is turbochargedonly looks are good
battery charges after 34 hours theres no turbo charging camera quality very poor
other than camera happy about everything else

the phone was continuously hanging and after restarting it stopped working completely as blue screen appearedi have raised return request however due to amazing return policy of amazon i am unable to return this defective product they were supposed to send a technician to inspect the product before approving for return the technician who is supposed to visit did not bother to come and his phone is switched off i tried to call up at the customer service several time and the call is not getting connected to any of the customer rep i am extremely dissatisfied with the services and policies of amazon it is 0 for me

good in this budget
this phone fell down not from height jst from bed and broke the screen within no time moreover for long day searched for service centre but could not find onein aligarhthis phone stops each application u open and gives a msg that this app has been stopped 
good phone but charging takes whole lot of time and battery also drains pretty fast
very bad performance after 2 weeks of purchase phone is getting turn off even if there is 100 battery and restarting after 23 hrs even having speaker issues
superb product
it came with old firmware and took 3 hours for update multiple updatesthought i am upgrading my phone from lenovo note 5 to lenovo note 8 but lots of good features missing definately not worth the moneypost oreo update the phone is heating up a lot service center not having any resolution
a little bit heating problem
lenovo k8 note has big battery issue and over heating issue
worst phone 4hrs battery life heats uphangs amazon tested and confirmed battery draining but not taking back as i dont have its boxwarningdo not buy i had to sell and buy another phone
very easy to handle even while travelling battery life is excellent gets little warm when used for more than half an hour at a stretch tough yet trendy
phone is good but has little problem with network connection also getting heat
good one
it is a good phone except slight heating issue and photo quality is not so good phone heated up lightly after 15 to 20 min of use
i have purchased this phone 3 months back and was very excited when the phone arrived honestly speaking every thing in this phone is good except the battery life the battery really sucks it doesnt really make any difference weather the internet is on or off the battery drains like hell even in the standby mode which is really disappointing the battery drains very fast even when the battery saver mode is on a 4000 mah battery should have lasted longer and lenovo could have worked in a bit better way to increase the battery power as compared to redmi note 4 which comes with a 4100 mah battery and is simply brilliant in its segment with such a lower price as compared to this phone hope you understand this and do some thing better towards resolution
problems to attached with pc

good product sunny

waste of money
poorui is very bad it always crashes4gb ram only for publicitydevelopers not fixing bugsboot loop bugui is not customised for hardwarepoor updates
no issues of camera or heating till a certain permissible extent best buy in this segment camera performance is very much higher than other phones at this price
not upto standard k4 is much better than this
since the day i received the lenovo k8 note phone the snapshot button is not working what to do
i never expect such a bad quality from such a reputed brand like lenovo from this phone i have lost my trust and will never buy lenovo again
good
worst phonewithin 6 months geating problem started plus battery problem i have to charge battery atleast 3 times in a day i you go to service center for solution they will just format your phone  issue doesnt get resolved
awesome product
i liked it not so stylish but good budget smartphone with extra bundled features
not able to send and receive sms
waste of money

very low quality battery is very low signal is not working and more
killer mobile killed my expectations rear dual camera uselessscreen cast does not work bugs in messaging app
only camera was better very bad product  after few days charging was slow is tooks around 6 to 7 hours  and when calling someone it is over heat and also when playing any video screen was flashingamazon was refunded my amount thanks for that

best phone
bluetooth is not working properly
stock android software on this phone is really bad absolutely no functionality at all also no backlit home buttons what are you guys thinking i had to return this phone due to bad software hardware has no use if software is badcorrect your software by adding appropriate user interface and backlit buttons
phone is working fine processor and battery performances are very good connectivity is also cool only concern is with over heating set is getting hot after 30 mins of continuous use the heating problem needs be addressed to make the set a perfect one
this product is utter wastetouch is not satisfactorymany options are unavailableits not worthy for its price
just average productnothing specialnot happy with this phone
nice
phones seems to be ok but battery is very poor drains on its own mi is far better compared to lenovo k8 never buy this phoneits a loss if you buy i returned in few days and amazon return policy is also not good they will assign some person to check who will take his own time and amazon will not refund they will replace the phone with another phone with same troubles later i requested for refund its a huge process flipkart is very simple
net work signal have ful but ist not work and not set to custom ring tone totally very very poor
missed call  message coming after notification light not glowing how to solve this problem
excellent productüòÑ
this set is having problem need help
bad
low light camera quality is too poor
screenshot icon not mentioned this mobile and all futures not mentioned this mobile
amazing productno heating issuebattery could have stayed a lil longer for the 4000mah description great features and looks good too headsets are not provided in the box
its very nice k84gb 64gb mobile all features are awesome i have received it on 140917 as promised only the issue of battery life is matter of concern today updated by lenovo regarding these issues lets see but overall good choice
good phone around 10k for all round performance
wort product got a damaged one has some issue with network amazon service was not good dnt buy this product
45 starsi received this phone on 22032018i did a lot of research before buying this and the issue which most of the people were having wereoverheatinglow battery optimizationdepth mode etcso first of all im an average person with quite a bit of knowledge of smartphone specsi found this smartphone to be great according to myselfoverheating was not an issue to me even though im bit of a gamer and i do play heavy games often surely the phone does heat a bit but not as much as id have to stop using it or playing games on itbattery is a great deal for mei tend to spend most of time on my phone but then also i think battery is very powerfuland for surfing sites n apps the battery wont drop a single percent for about 20 minsand the turbo charger is just awesomeit charges so quickly that you just cant arguelastly the camerawell im someone who never owned a phone with dual camera beforeso i liked it pretty muchits not a problem for me so if you are someone who only had single camera phone till now then this k8 note camera is great for youbut if you have owned such earlier then i dont know what to compare it withi hope this helps
good phone
very good product
dint like  wish to return but its nt returnable
the phone came in due time apart from the said bokeh affect from the dual camerasthe performance is cool good battery life stock android with nougat and priority based updates from google all in all a good buy in 14k probably most suitable in this price range
the phone have multiple fuction under such price
good product
excellent product manufactured by lenovo its owesome 
its one speaker is not working
first of all i wd say the phn is overvalued considering its price to features parametersounddisplay touch effects all needs much improvementsthen there is hanging issues egdolby feature gets hanged oftencamera rear doesnt give u expected pic clarity though depth effect is present in its dual rear interfaceall in all disappointed although i was expecting reasonable better features for a 12  13 kdevice taking lenovo into consideration
its been over 6 months havent faced any problem till this dategood for gamingfast chargingvery good photo quality
phone is working very slow really worst product there is headset in the box
everything good except for the heating and battery fast drainage and slow recharge compared to my previous mi
superb phone value for money
good but note best
lenovo k8 note is a good device but its not a perfect onethe first problem which i faced is its overheating and its ram managementhardly 2gb is available for our usagebut the main attraction of this phone is its camera
its a great phone the music is awesome in headphones for this price its a very premium phone with looks feel and usage  its fluid to use the phone gets little hot but not that much its during charging and heavy usage i will definitely recommend this phone who looks a great phone for low cost or any one who looks a great phone
battery draining very fastly charging taking for long time poor product
phone is awesomebut yeah it overheatsidk whybut mine is heating fast over all its all goodloved it

fantastic product and awesome service provide by amazon thanks to amazon for fast delivery  device is very good and works fluently
